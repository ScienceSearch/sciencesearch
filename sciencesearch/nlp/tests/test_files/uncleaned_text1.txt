Once there lived two brothers who were princes in the land. The elder brother1 was a hunter. He loved the deep woods and the chase. He went from dawn to dark with his bow and his arrows. Swiftly he could run; he was strong and bright-eyed. The younger brother was a dreamer; his eyes were gentle. From dawn to dark he would sit with his book or with his thoughts. Sweetly could  he sing of love, or of war, or of the green fields, and tell stories of the fairies and of the time of the gods. Upon a fair day of summer the hunter betook himself very early to the woods, as was his wont. But the dreamer took his book in his hand, and, musing, he wandered by the stream s '.'' side, where grew the yellow mimulus. It is the fairies money, he said; it will buy all the joys of fairyland So he went o n his way, smiling. And when he had continued for some time, he came to a holy shrine. And there led to the shrine a hundred steps, moss-grown and grey. Beside the steps were gu ardi an lions, carved in stone. Behind the shrine was Fugi, the Mystic Mountain, white and beautiful, and all the lesser hills rose softly up like prayers. O peerless Fugi, said the dreamer, O passionless wonder mountain To see thee is to hear sweet music without sound, the blessed harmony of silence.
