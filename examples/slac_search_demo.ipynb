Mother had she none , and her father was a noble <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">lord</span> and a warrior . He was at the Court of the Shogun , or he had weighty affairs at the capital , or he went here and there with armies and overcame his enemies . <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> saw little of him . Long years she dwelt with her nurse and her <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> within the walls of her father ’ s castle . High walls were they and well-guarded , and at their foot was a deep moat which was rosy with lotus <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> all the seventh month . When the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> was some <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sixteen years</span> old her father the _daimyo_ came home victorious from a foray , and she went with her <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> to meet him in the gate . She was dressed in her bravest , and as became her rank . “ My <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">lord</span> and father , ” she said , “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> is your honourable return. ” “ Child , how you have grown ! ” her father said , astonished . “ How old are you , <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> ? ” “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sixteen years</span> old , <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">lord</span> , ” she said . “ By all the gods , you are become a little great young <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> , and I thought you were a baby and brought you home a doll for a home-coming gift. ” He laughed , but presently afterwards grew grave , and in deep thought he went into the castle . Soon after this he began to look about him , to find a fitting husband for his daughter . “ Best it should be done now , ” he said , “ for a wonder has come to pass , and I am at peace with every _daimyo_ in the land -- and it will not last. ” The <span class=\"kw-training\">Lord of Ako</span> , in Harima , had three tall sons , fine young men and warriors all . “ The eldest is over old , ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of Omi . “ The youngest is a boy -- but what of the middle brother ? It seems to me that the middle brother should do well . They say that second thoughts are best , ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of Omi . So after messengers had come and gone , the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> was betrothed to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Ako</span> , and there was great rejoicing in all the country-side , for all the man and the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maiden</span> had never set eyes on one another . The <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> was very glad when she saw the presents that came from her bridegroom ’ s house . She sat with the seamstress of the castle and fingered the soft stuffs of her fine new robes . For the rest , she played with her <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> the live-long day , or took her broidery frame , plying the needle and long silken thread . It was the month of May , and very often they took the air in a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> , where <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> and her maids laughed together , and sometimes they spoke of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Ako</span> and how brave and beautiful he was , how skilful in art and in war , and how rich . When evening came they slipped down the gallery steps and into the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">garden</span> , where they went hither and thither , hand in hand , to enjoy the cool air and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> scent of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> . One night the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> walked in the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">garden</span> according to her wont . The <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> rose , round and silver . “ Ah me , ” sighed one of the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> , “ the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> is a love-lorn <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . Look how pale and wan she goes , and even now she will hide her eyes with her long sleeve of cloud. ” “ You speak sooth , ” returned <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> , “ the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> is a love-lorn <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> ; but have you seen her faint sister who is sadder and fairer than she ? ” “ Who , then , is the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> ’ s sister ? ” asked all the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> at once . <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> said , “ Come and see -- come. ” With that she drew them along the paths of the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">garden</span> to the still pond , where were the dancing fireflies and the frogs that sang musically . Holding each other ’ s hands , the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> looked down into the water , and one and all they beheld the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> ’ s sister , and they laughed softly together . While they played by the water ’ s brim , the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> ’ s foot slipped upon a smooth stone , and most assuredly she would have fallen into the pond . But all of a sudden a youth leapt forward out of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> secrecy of the night , and caught her in his arms . For a moment all the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> beheld the glimmer of his garments . Then he was gone . <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> stood alone , trembling . Down gazed the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> , wide-eyed and sorrowful ; and still more sorrowful and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> , upwards gazed the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> ’ s pale sister . They saw a band of silent <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> who stood in a wilderness of blossoming peony <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> , that grew to the water ’ s edge . It was the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> who loved them and had them planted so . Now the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> turned without a word and moved along the paths of the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">garden</span> very slowly , hanging her head . When she came to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> she left all her <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> save one , and went silently to her bower . There she was for a long space , saying nothing . She sat and traced the pattern on her robe with the point of her finger . And Sada , her <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maiden</span> , was over against her . At length , “ He was a great <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">lord</span> , ” said <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> . “ Truth , lady. ” “ He was young. ” “ He was passing well-favoured. ” “ Alas ! he saved my life , and I had not time to thank him. ” “ The <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> shone upon the jewelled mounting of his sword. ” “ And his robe that was broidered with peony <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> -- my peony flowers. ” “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> , the hour grows very late. ” “ Well , then , untie my girdle. ” “ You look pale , lady. ” “ Small marvel , I am weary. ” “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> , what of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Ako</span> ? ” “ What of him ? Why , I have not seen him . Enough , let be -- no more of him . Alas ! I am drowsy , I know not what I say. ” After this night the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> , that had been so fresh and fair and dancing gay as a wave of the sea , fell into a pale melancholy . By day she sighed , and by night she wept . She smiled no more as she beheld her rich wedding-garments , and she would not play any more with her <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> . She wandered like a shadow , or lay speechless in her bower . And all the wise men and all the wise women of that country-side were not able to heal her of her sickness . Then the maid Sada , weeping and hiding her face with her sleeve , went to the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of the House and told him of the moonlight adventure and the fair youth of the peony bed . “ Ah me , ” she said , “ my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> mistress pines and dies for the love of this beautiful young man. ” “ Child , ” said the _daimyo_ , “ how you talk ! My daughter ’ s <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">garden</span> is well guarded by walls and by men-at-arms . It is not possible that any stranger should enter it . What , then , is this tale of the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> and a _samurai_ in peony garments and all manner of other foolishness , and how will such a tale sound in the ears of the <span class=\"kw-training\">Lord of Ako</span> ? ” But Sada wept and said , “ My mistress will die. ” “ To fight in the field , to flatter at Court and to speak in Council , all these are easy , ” said the _daimyo_ , “ but preserve me from the affairs of my women , for they are too hard for me. ” With that he made a search of all the castle and the castle grounds , but not a trace did he find of any stranger in hiding . That night the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> called piteously for the cooler air , so they bore her out on to her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> , where she lay in O Sada ’ s arms . A minstrel of the household took his _biwa_ , and to soothe her he made this song : “ Music of my lute -- Is it born , does it die , Is it truth or a lie ? Whence , whence and where , Enchanted air ? Music of my lute Is mute . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sweet</span> scents in the night -- Do they float , do they seem , Are they essence of dream , Or thus are they said The thoughts of the Dead ? <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sweet</span> scents in the night Delight. ” Now , while the minstrel sang and touched his instrument , a fair youth stood up from the rosy sea of peonies by the pond . All there saw him clearly , his bright eyes , his sword , and his dress broidered with <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> . The <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> gave a wild cry and ran to the edge of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> , holding out her white arms . And immediately the vision passed away . But the minstrel took up his _biwa_ once more and sang : “ Love more strange than death -- Is it longer than life , Is it hotter than strife ? Strong , strong and blind , Transcending kind -- Love more strange than death Or breath. ” At this the mysterious knight of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> stood once again straight and tall , and his shining eyes were fixed upon the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> . Then a gentleman of the company of the _daimyo_ , who was a mighty man of war , drew his sword forthwith and leapt down amongst the peonies to do battle with the bold stranger that so gazed upon his master ’ s daughter . And at that a cloud drew across the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> ’ s face as if by faery , and of a sudden a great hot wind blew from the south . The lights died upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> , the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> held their garments together while their long gossamer sleeves floated out . All the peony bed was tossed about like a troubled sea , and the pink and white petals flew like foam . A mist , damp and over-sweet , hung upon the wind , so that all who were there grew faint and clung to one another , trembling . When they were recovered , they found the night still and the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> undimmed . The soldier of the _daimyo ’ s_ company stood panting and white as death at the steps of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> . In his right hand he held his unstained sword , in his left a perfect peony <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flower</span> . “ I have him , ” he shouted ; “ he could not escape me . I have him fast. ” <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> said , “ Give me the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flower</span> ” ; and he gave it her without a word , as one in a dream . Then <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> went to her bower and slept with the peony upon her breast and was satisfied . For nine days she kept the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flower</span> . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> colour came to her face , and the light to her eyes . She was perfectly healed of her sickness . She set the peony in a bronze vase and it did not droop or fade , but grew larger and more lovely all the nine days . At the end of this time the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Ako</span> came riding in great pomp and state to claim his long-promised <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . So he and the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> were wed in the midst of much feasting and rejoicing . Howbeit , they say she made but a pale bride . And the same day the peony withered and was thrown away . </div>\n",

The <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> rose , round and silver . “ Ah me , ” sighed one of the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> , “ the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> is a love-lorn <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . Look how pale and wan she goes , and even now she will hide her eyes with her long sleeve of cloud. ” “ You speak sooth , ” returned <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> , “ the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> is a love-lorn <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> ; but have you seen her faint sister who is sadder and fairer than she ? ” “ Who , then , is the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> ’ s sister ? ” asked all the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> at once . <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> said , “ Come and see -- come. ” With that she drew them along the paths of the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">garden</span> to the still pond , where were the dancing fireflies and the frogs that sang musically . Holding each other ’ s hands , the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> looked down into the water , and one and all they beheld the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> ’ s sister , and they laughed softly together . While they played by the water ’ s brim , the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> ’ s foot slipped upon a smooth stone , and most assuredly she would have fallen into the pond . But all of a sudden a youth leapt forward out of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> secrecy of the night , and caught her in his arms . For a moment all the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> beheld the glimmer of his garments . Then he was gone . <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> stood alone , trembling . Down gazed the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> , wide-eyed and sorrowful ; and still more sorrowful and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> , upwards gazed the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> ’ s pale sister . They saw a band of silent <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> who stood in a wilderness of blossoming peony <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> , that grew to the water ’ s edge . It was the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> who loved them and had them planted so . Now the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> turned without a word and moved along the paths of the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">garden</span> very slowly , hanging her head . When she came to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> she left all her <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> save one , and went silently to her bower . There she was for a long space , saying nothing . She sat and traced the pattern on her robe with the point of her finger . And Sada , her <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maiden</span> , was over against her . At length , “ He was a great <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">lord</span> , ” said <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> . “ Truth , lady. ” “ He was young. ” “ He was passing well-favoured. ” “ Alas ! he saved my life , and I had not time to thank him. ” “ The <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> shone upon the jewelled mounting of his sword. ” “ And his robe that was broidered with peony <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> -- my peony flowers. ” “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> , the hour grows very late. ” “ Well , then , untie my girdle. ” “ You look pale , lady. ” “ Small marvel , I am weary. ” “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> , what of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Ako</span> ? ” “ What of him ? Why , I have not seen him . Enough , let be -- no more of him . Alas ! I am drowsy , I know not what I say. ” After this night the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> , that had been so fresh and fair and dancing gay as a wave of the sea , fell into a pale melancholy . By day she sighed , and by night she wept . She smiled no more as she beheld her rich wedding-garments , and she would not play any more with her <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> . She wandered like a shadow , or lay speechless in her bower . And all the wise men and all the wise women of that country-side were not able to heal her of her sickness . Then the maid Sada , weeping and hiding her face with her sleeve , went to the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of the House and told him of the moonlight adventure and the fair youth of the peony bed . “ Ah me , ” she said , “ my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> mistress pines and dies for the love of this beautiful young man. ” “ Child , ” said the _daimyo_ , “ how you talk ! My daughter ’ s <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">garden</span> is well guarded by walls and by men-at-arms . It is not possible that any stranger should enter it . What , then , is this tale of the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> and a _samurai_ in peony garments and all manner of other foolishness , and how will such a tale sound in the ears of the <span class=\"kw-training\">Lord of Ako</span> ? ” But Sada wept and said , “ My mistress will die. ” “ To fight in the field , to flatter at Court and to speak in Council , all these are easy , ” said the _daimyo_ , “ but preserve me from the affairs of my women , for they are too hard for me. ” With that he made a search of all the castle and the castle grounds , but not a trace did he find of any stranger in hiding . That night the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> called piteously for the cooler air , so they bore her out on to her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> , where she lay in O Sada ’ s arms . A minstrel of the household took his _biwa_ , and to soothe her he made this song : “ Music of my lute -- Is it born , does it die , Is it truth or a lie ? Whence , whence and where , Enchanted air ? Music of my lute Is mute . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sweet</span> scents in the night -- Do they float , do they seem , Are they essence of dream , Or thus are they said The thoughts of the Dead ? <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sweet</span> scents in the night Delight. ” Now , while the minstrel sang and touched his instrument , a fair youth stood up from the rosy sea of peonies by the pond . All there saw him clearly , his bright eyes , his sword , and his dress broidered with <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> . The <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> gave a wild cry and ran to the edge of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> , holding out her white arms . And immediately the vision passed away . But the minstrel took up his _biwa_ once more and sang : “ Love more strange than death -- Is it longer than life , Is it hotter than strife ? Strong , strong and blind , Transcending kind -- Love more strange than death Or breath. ” At this the mysterious knight of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> stood once again straight and tall , and his shining eyes were fixed upon the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> . Then a gentleman of the company of the _daimyo_ , who was a mighty man of war , drew his sword forthwith and leapt down amongst the peonies to do battle with the bold stranger that so gazed upon his master ’ s daughter . And at that a cloud drew across the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> ’ s face as if by faery , and of a sudden a great hot wind blew from the south . The lights died upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> , the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">maidens</span> held their garments together while their long gossamer sleeves floated out . All the peony bed was tossed about like a troubled sea , and the pink and white petals flew like foam . A mist , damp and over-sweet , hung upon the wind , so that all who were there grew faint and clung to one another , trembling . When they were recovered , they found the night still and the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">moon</span> undimmed . The soldier of the _daimyo ’ s_ company stood panting and white as death at the steps of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">garden gallery</span> . In his right hand he held his unstained sword , in his left a perfect peony <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flower</span> . “ I have him , ” he shouted ; “ he could not escape me . I have him fast. ” <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> said , “ Give me the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flower</span> ” ; and he gave it her without a word , as one in a dream . Then <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Aya</span> went to her bower and slept with the peony upon her breast and was satisfied . For nine days she kept the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flower</span> . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> colour came to her face , and the light to her eyes . She was perfectly healed of her sickness . She set the peony in a bronze vase and it did not droop or fade , but grew larger and more lovely all the nine days . At the end of this time the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Ako</span> came riding in great pomp and state to claim his long-promised <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . So he and the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">Lady Aya</span> were wed in the midst of much feasting and rejoicing . Howbeit , they say she made but a pale bride . And the same day the peony withered and was thrown away . </div><h1>Experiment: file3</h1>\n",

       "            <div class='highlighted-text'><span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> , the young _samurai_ , owed allegiance to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Noto</span> . He was a soldier , a courtier , and a poet . He had a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> voice and a beautiful face , a noble form and a very winning address . He was a graceful dancer , and excelled in every manly sport . He was wealthy and generous and kind . He was beloved by rich and by poor . Now his _daimyo_ , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Noto</span> , wanted a man to undertake a mission of trust . He chose <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> , and called him to his presence . “ Are you loyal ? ” said the _daimyo_ . “ My <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> , you know it , ” answered <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> . “ Do you <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> me , then ? ” asked the _daimyo_ . “ Ay , my good <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> , kneeling before him . “ Then carry my message , ” said the _daimyo_ . “ Ride and do not spare your beast . Ride straight , and fear not the mountains nor the enemies ’ country . Stay not for storm nor any other thing . Lose your life ; but betray not your trust . Above all , do not look any maid between the eyes . Ride , and bring me word again quickly. ” Thus spoke the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Noto</span> . So <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> got him to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">horse</span> , and away he <span class=\"kw-tuned\">rode</span> upon his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">quest</span> . Obedient to his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> ’ s commands , he spared not his good beast . He <span class=\"kw-tuned\">rode</span> straight , and was not afraid of the steep mountain passes nor of the enemies ’ country . Ere he had been three days upon the road the autumn tempest burst , for it was the ninth month . Down poured the rain in a torrent . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> bowed his head and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">rode</span> on . The wind howled in the pine-tree branches . It blew a typhoon . The good <span class=\"kw-tuned\">horse</span> trembled and could scarcely keep its feet , but <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> spoke to it and urged it on . His own cloak he drew close about him and held it so that it might not blow away , and in this wise he <span class=\"kw-tuned\">rode</span> on . The fierce storm swept away many a familiar landmark of the road , and buffeted the _samurai_ so that he became weary almost to fainting . Noontide was as dark as twilight , twilight was as dark as night , and when night fell it was as black as the night of Yomi , where lost souls wander and cry . By this time <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> had lost his way in a wild , lonely place , where , as it seemed to him , no human soul inhabited . His <span class=\"kw-tuned\">horse</span> could carry him no longer , and he wandered on foot through bogs and marshes , through rocky and thorny tracks , until he fell into deep despair . “ Alack ! ” he cried , “ must I die in this wilderness and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">quest</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Noto</span> be unfulfilled ? ” At this moment the great winds blew away the clouds of the sky , so that the moon shone very brightly forth , and by the sudden light <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> saw a little hill on his right hand . Upon the hill was a small thatched cottage , and before the cottage grew three <span class=\"kw-tuned\">green</span> weeping-willow trees . “ Now , indeed , the gods be thanked ! ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> , and he climbed the hill in no time . Light shone from the chinks of the cottage door , and smoke curled out of a hole in the roof . The three <span class=\"kw-tuned\">willow trees</span> swayed and flung out their <span class=\"kw-tuned\">green</span> streamers in the wind . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> threw his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">horse</span> ’ s rein over a branch of one of them , and called for admittance to the longed-for shelter . At once the cottage door was opened by an old woman , very poorly but neatly clad . “ Who rides abroad upon such a night ? ” she asked , “ and what wills he here ? ” “ I am a weary traveller , lost and benighted upon your lonely moor . My name is <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> . I am a _samurai_ in the service of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Noto</span> , upon whose business I ride . Show me hospitality for the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> of the gods . I crave food and shelter for myself and my horse. ” As the young man stood speaking the water streamed from his garments . He reeled a little , and put out a hand to hold on by the side-post of the door . “ Come in , come in , young sir ! ” cried the old woman , full of pity . “ Come in to the warm fire . You are very welcome . We have but coarse fare to offer , but it shall be set before you with great good-will . As to your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">horse</span> , I see you have delivered him to my daughter ; he is in good hands. ” At this <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> turned sharply round . Just behind him , in the dim light , stood a very young girl with the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">horse</span> ’ s rein thrown over her arm . Her garments were blown about and her long loose hair streamed out upon the wind . The _samurai_ wondered how she had come there . Then the old woman drew him into the cottage and shut the door . Before the fire sat the good man of the house , and the two old people did the very best they could for <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> . They gave him dry garments , comforted him with hot rice wine , and quickly prepared a good supper for him . Presently the daughter of the house came in , and retired behind a screen to comb her hair and to dress afresh . Then she came forth to wait upon him . She wore a blue robe of homespun cotton . Her feet were bare . Her hair was not tied nor confined in any way , but lay along her smooth cheeks , and hung , straight and long and black , to her very knees . She was slender and graceful . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> judged her to be about fifteen years old , and knew well that she was the fairest <span class=\"kw-tuned\">maiden</span> he had ever seen . At length she knelt at his side to pour wine into his cup . She held the wine-bottle in two hands and bent her head . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> turned to look at her . When she had made an end of pouring the wine and had set down the bottle , their glances met , and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> looked at her full between the eyes , for he forgot altogether the warning of his _daimyo_ , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Noto</span> . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Maiden</span> , ” he said , “ what is your name ? ” She answered : “ They call me the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green</span> Willow. ” “ The dearest name on earth , ” he said , and again he looked her between the eyes . And because he looked so long her face grew rosy red , from chin to forehead , and though she smiled her eyes filled with tears . Ah me , for the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Noto</span> ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">quest</span> ! Then <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> made this little song : “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Long-haired maiden</span> , do you know That with the red dawn I must go ? Do you wish me far away ? Cruel <span class=\"kw-tuned\">long-haired maiden</span> , say -- <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Long-haired maiden</span> , if you know That with the red dawn I must go , Why , oh why , do you blush so ? ” And the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">maiden</span> , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> , answered : “ The dawn comes if I will or no ; Never leave me , never go . My sleeve shall hide the blush away . The dawn comes if I will or no ; Never leave me , never go . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> , I lift my long sleeve so .... ” “ Oh , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> ... ” sighed <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> . That night he lay before the fire -- still , but with wide eyes , for no sleep came to him though he was weary . He was sick for <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> . Yet by the rules of his service he was bound in honour to think of no such thing . Moreover , he had the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">quest</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Noto</span> that lay heavy on his heart , and he longed to keep truth and loyalty . At the first peep of day he rose up . He looked upon the kind old man who had been his host , and left a purse of gold at his side as he slept . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">maiden</span> and her mother lay behind the screen . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> saddled and bridled his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">horse</span> , and mounting , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">rode</span> slowly away through the mist of the early morning . The storm was quite over and it was as still as Paradise . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">green</span> grass and the leaves shone with the wet . The sky was clear , and the path very bright with autumn flowers ; but <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> was sad . When the sunlight streamed across his saddlebow , “ Ah , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> , ” he sighed ; and at noontide it was “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> ” ; and “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> , ” when the twilight fell . That night he lay in a deserted shrine , and the place was so holy that in spite of all he slept from midnight till the dawn . Then he rose , having it in his mind to wash himself in a cold stream that flowed near by , so as to go refreshed upon his journey ; but he was stopped upon the shrine ’ s threshold . There lay the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> , prone upon the ground . A slender thing she lay , face downwards , with her black hair flung about her . She lifted a hand and held <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> by the sleeve . “ My <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> , ” she said , and fell to sobbing piteously . He took her in his arms without a word , and soon he set her on his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">horse</span> before him , and together they <span class=\"kw-tuned\">rode</span> the livelong day . It was little they recked of the road they went , for all the while they looked into each other ’ s eyes . The heat and the cold were nothing to them . They felt not the sun nor the rain ; of truth or falsehood they thought nothing at all ; nor of filial piety , nor of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Noto</span> ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">quest</span> , nor of honour nor plighted word . They knew but the one thing . Alas , for the ways of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> ! At last they came to an unknown city , where they stayed . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> carried gold and jewels in his girdle , so they found a house built of white wood , spread with <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> white mats . In every dim room there could be heard the sound of the garden waterfall , whilst the swallow flitted across and across the paper lattice . Here they dwelt , knowing but the one thing . Here they dwelt three years of happy days , and for <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> the years were like garlands of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> flowers . In the autumn of the third year it chanced that the two of them went forth into the garden at dusk , for they had a wish to see the round moon rise ; and as they watched , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green Willow</span> began to shake and shiver . “ My dear , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> , “ you shake and shiver ; and it is no wonder , the night wind is chill . Come in. ” And he put his arm around her . At this she gave a long and pitiful cry , very loud and full of agony , and when she had uttered the cry she failed , and dropped her head upon her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> ’ s breast . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> , ” she whispered , “ say a prayer for me ; I die. ” “ Oh , say not so , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> ! You are but weary ; you are faint. ” He carried her to the stream ’ s side , where the iris grew like swords , and the lotus-leaves like shields , and laved her forehead with water . He said : “ What is it , my dear ? Look up and live. ” “ The tree , ” she moaned , “ the tree ... they have cut down my tree . Remember the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Green</span> Willow. ” With that she slipped , as it seemed , from his arms to his feet ; and he , casting himself upon the ground , found only silken garments , bright coloured , warm and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sweet</span> , and straw sandals , scarlet-thonged . In after years , when <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> was a holy man , he travelled from shrine to shrine , painfully upon his feet , and acquired much merit . Once , at nightfall , he found himself upon a lonely moor . On his right hand he beheld a little hill , and on it the sad ruins of a poor thatched cottage . The door swung to and fro with broken latch and creaking hinge . Before it stood three old stumps of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">willow trees</span> that had long since been cut down . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> stood for a long time still and silent . Then he sang gently to himself : “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Long-haired maiden</span> , do you know That with the red dawn I must go ? Do you wish me far away ? Cruel <span class=\"kw-tuned\">long-haired maiden</span> , say -- <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Long-haired maiden</span> , if you know That with the red dawn I must go , Why , oh why , do you blush so ? ” “ Ah , foolish song ! The gods forgive me .... I should have recited the Holy Sutra for the Dead , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tomodata</span> . </div><h1>Experiment: file1</h1>\n",

       "            <div class='highlighted-text'>Once there lived two <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brothers</span> who were <span class=\"kw-training\">princes</span> in the land . The elder <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> was a <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">hunter</span> . He <span class=\"kw-tuned\">loved</span> the deep woods and the chase . He went from dawn to dark with his bow and his arrows . Swiftly he could run ; he was strong and bright-eyed . The younger <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> was a <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> ; his eyes were gentle . From dawn to dark he would sit with his book or with his thoughts . Sweetly could he <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sing</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> , or of war , or of the green fields , and tell stories of the fairies and of the time of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> . Upon a fair day of summer the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">hunter</span> betook himself very early to the woods , as was his wont . But the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> took his book in his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">hand</span> , and , musing , he <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wandered</span> by the stream ’ s side , where grew the yellow <span class=\"kw-training\">mimulus</span> . “ It is the fairies ’ money , ” he said ; “ it will buy all the joys of fairyland ! ” So he went on his way , smiling . And when he had continued for some time , he came to a holy <span class=\"kw-tuned\">shrine</span> . And there led to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">shrine</span> a hundred steps , moss-grown and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">grey</span> . Beside the steps were guardian lions , carved in <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stone</span> . Behind the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">shrine</span> was <span class=\"kw-training\">Fugi</span> , the <span class=\"kw-training\">Mystic Mountain</span> , white and beautiful , and all the lesser hills rose softly up like prayers . “ O peerless <span class=\"kw-training\">Fugi</span> , ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> , “ O passionless wonder mountain ! To see thee is to hear sweet music without <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sound</span> , the blessed harmony of silence. ” Then he climbed the steps , moss-grown and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">grey</span> . And the lions that were carved in <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stone</span> rose up and followed him , and they came with him to the inner gates of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">shrine</span> and stayed there . In the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">shrine</span> there was a hush of noonday . The smoke of incense curled and hung upon the air . Dimly shone the gold and the bronze , the lights and the mystic mirrors . There was a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sound</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">singing</span> in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">shrine</span> , and turning , the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> saw a man who stood at his right <span class=\"kw-tuned\">hand</span> . The man was taller than any child of earth . Moreover , his face shone with the glory of a youth that can not pass away . He held a year-old child upon his arm and hushed it to sleep , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">singing</span> a strange melody . When the babe fell asleep he was well pleased , and smiled . “ What babe is that ? ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> . “ O <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> , it is no babe , but a spirit. ” “ Then , my lord , what are you ? ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> . “ I am Jizo , who guards the souls of little children . It is most pitiful to hear their crying when they come to the sandy river-bed , the _Sai-no-kawara_ . O <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> , they come alone , as needs they must , wailing and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wandering</span> , stretching out their pretty <span class=\"kw-tuned\">hands</span> . They have a task , which is to pile <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stones</span> for a tower of prayer . But in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> come the _Oni_ to throw down the towers and to scatter all the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stones</span> . So the children are made afraid , and their labour is lost. ” “ What then , my lord Jizo ? ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> . “ Why , then I come , for the Great One gives me leave . And I call ‘ Come hither , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wandering</span> souls. ’ And they fly to me that I may hide them in my long sleeves . I carry them in my arms and on my breast , where they lie light and cold , -- as light and cold as the morning mist upon the mountains. ” When he had spoken , the year-old child stirred and murmured : so he rocked it , and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wandered</span> to and fro in the quiet temple court and hushed it as he went . So the swift moments flew and the noontide passed away . Presently there came to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">shrine</span> a lady most gentle and beautiful . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Grey</span> was her robe , and she had silver sandals on her feet . She said , “ I am called The Merciful . For mankind ’ s dear sake , I have refused eternal peace . The Great One has given to me a thousand <span class=\"kw-tuned\">loving</span> arms , arms of mercy . And my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">hands</span> are full of gifts . O <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> , when you dream your dreams you shall see me in my lotus boat when I sail upon the mystic mere. ” “ Lady , Lady Kwannon ... ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> . Then came one clothed in blue , speaking with a sweet , deep , well-known voice . “ I am Benten , the Goddess of the Sea and the Goddess of Song . My dragons are about me and beneath my feet . See their green scales and their opal eyes . Greeting , O <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> ! ” After her there came a band of blooming boys , laughing and holding out their rosy arms . “ We are the Sons of the Sea Goddess , ” they said . “ Come , <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> , come to our cool caves. ” The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of Roads came , and his three messengers with him . Three apes were the three messengers . The first ape covered his eyes with his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">hands</span> , for he could see no evil thing . The second ape covered his ears with his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">hands</span> , for he could hear no evil thing . The third ape covered his mouth with his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">hands</span> , for he could speak no evil thing . Then came She , the fearful woman who takes the clothes of the dead who are not able to pay their toll , so that they must stand shivering at the entrance of the mysterious Three Ways . They are unfortunate indeed . And many and many a vision the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> saw in that enchanted <span class=\"kw-tuned\">shrine</span> . And dark <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> fell , with storm and tempest and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sound</span> of rain upon the roof . Yet the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> never stirred . Suddenly there was a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sound</span> of hurrying feet without . A voice called loud , “ My <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> ! ... ” In sprang the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">hunter</span> through the golden temple doors . “ Where are you ? ” he cried , “ my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> ! ” He had his swinging lantern in his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">hand</span> and held it high , as he flung his long blown hair back over his shoulder . His face was bright with the rain upon it , his eyes were as keen as an eagle ’ s . “ O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> ... ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> , and ran to meet him . “ Now the dear <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> be thanked that I have you safe and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sound</span> , ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">hunter</span> . “ Half the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> I have sought you , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wandering</span> in the forest and by the stream ’ s side . I was all to blame for leaving you ... my little brother. ” With that , he took his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> ’ s face between his two warm <span class=\"kw-tuned\">hands</span> . But the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> sighed , “ I have been with the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> all <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> , ” he said , “ and I think I see them still . The place is holy. ” Then the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">hunter</span> flashed his light upon the temple walls , upon the gilding and the bronze . “ I see no <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> , ” he said . “ What see you , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> ? ” “ I see a row of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stones</span> , broken images , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">grey</span> , with moss-grown feet. ” “ They are <span class=\"kw-tuned\">grey</span> because they are sad , they are sad because they are forgotten , ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> . But the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">hunter</span> took him by the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">hand</span> and led him into the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> . The <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">dreamer</span> said , “ O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">brother</span> , how sweet is the scent of the bean fields after the rain. ” “ Now bind your sandals on , ” said the <span class=\"kw-training kw-tuned\">hunter</span> , “ and I ’ ll run you a race to our home . ” </div><h1>Experiment: file4</h1>\n",

       "            <div class='highlighted-text'><span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> was the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">China</span> . Many books he read , and he never forgot what was in them . All the characters he knew as he knew the lines in the palm of his hand . He learned secrets from birds and beasts , and herbs and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> and trees , and rocks and metals . He knew magic and poetry and philosophy . He grew full of years and wisdom . All the people honoured him ; but he was not happy , for he had a word written upon his heart . The word was _Mutability_ . It was with him day and night , and sorely it troubled him . Moreover , in the days of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> a tyrant ruled over <span class=\"kw-tuned\">China</span> , and he made the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> ’ s life a burden . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> , ” he said , “ teach the nightingales of my wood to sing me the songs of the Chinese poets. ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> could not do it for all his wisdom . “ Alas , liege , ” he said , “ ask me another thing and I will give it you , though it cost me the blood of my heart. ” “ Have a care , ” said the Emperor , “ look to your ways . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise</span> men are cheap in <span class=\"kw-tuned\">China</span> ; am I one to be dishonoured ? ” “ Ask me another thing , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> . “ Well , then , scent me the peony with the scent of the jessamine . The peony is brilliant , imperial ; the jessamine is small , pale , foolish . Nevertheless , its perfume is sweet . Scent me the peony with the scent of the jessamine. ” But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stood</span> silent and downcast . “ By the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> , ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> the Emperor , “ this <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wise man</span> is a fool ! Here , some of you , off with his head. ” “ Liege , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> , “ spare me my life and I will set sail for Horaizan where grows the herb Immortality . I will pluck this herb and bring it back to you again , that you may live and reign for ever. ” The Emperor considered . “ Well , go , ” he said , “ and linger not , or it will be the worse for you. ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> went and found brave companions to go with him on the great adventure , and he <span class=\"kw-tuned\">manned</span> a junk with the most famous mariners of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">China</span> , and he took stores on board , and gold ; and when he had made all things ready he set sail in the seventh month , about the time of the full moon . The Emperor himself came down to the seashore . “ Speed , speed , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> , ” he said ; “ fetch me the herb Immortality , and see that you do it presently . If you return without it , you and your companions shall die the death. ” “ Farewell , liege , ” called <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> from the junk . So they went with a fair wind for their white sails . The boards creaked , the ropes quivered , the water splashed against the junk ’ s side , the sailors sang as they steered a course eastward , the brave companions were merry . But the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">China</span> looked forward and looked back , and was sad because of the word written upon his heart -- _Mutability_ . The junk of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> was for many days upon the wild sea , steering a course eastwards . He and the sailors and the brave companions suffered many things . The great heat burnt them , and the great cold froze them . Hungry and thirsty they were , and some of them fell sick and died . More were slain in a fight with pirates . Then came the dread typhoon , and mountain waves that swept the junk . The masts and the sails were washed away with the rich stores , and the gold was lost for ever . Drowned were the famous mariners , and the brave companions every one . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> was left alone . In the grey dawn he looked up . Far to the east he saw a mountain , very faint , the colour of pearl , and on the mountain top there grew a tree , tall , with spreading branches . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> murmured : “ The Island of Horaizan is east of the east , and there is Fusan , the Wonder Mountain . On the heights of Fusan there grows a tree whose branches hide the Mysteries of Life. ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> lay weak and weary and could not lift a finger . Nevertheless , the junk glided nearer and nearer to the shore . Still and blue grew the waters of the sea , and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> saw the bright green grass and the many-coloured <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> of the island . Soon there came troops of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> men and maidens bearing garlands and singing songs of welcome ; and they waded out into the water and drew the junk to land . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> was aware of the sweet and spicy odours that clung to their garments and their hair . At their invitation he left the junk , which drifted away and was no more seen . He said , “ I have come to Horaizan the Blest. ” Looking up he saw that the trees were full of birds with blue and golden feathers . The birds filled the air with delightful melody . On all sides there hung the orange and the citron , the persimmon and the pomegranate , the peach and the plum and the loquat . The ground at his feet was as a rich brocade , embroidered with every <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flower</span> that is . The happy dwellers in Horaizan took him by the hands and spoke lovingly to him . “ How strange it is , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> , “ I do not feel my old age any more. ” “ What is old age ? ” they said . “ Neither do I feel any pain. ” “ Now what is pain ? ” they said . “ The word is no longer written on my heart. ” “ What word do you speak of , beloved ? ” “ _Mutability_ is the word. ” “ And what may be its interpretation ? ” “ Tell me , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> , “ is this death ? ” “ We have never heard of death , ” said the inhabitants of Horaizan . * * * * * The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> of Japan was Wasobiobe . He was full as <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wise</span> as the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">China</span> . He was not old but <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> . The people honoured him and loved him . Often he was happy enough . It was his pleasure to venture alone in a frail boat out to sea , there to meditate in the wild and watery waste . Once as he did this it chanced that he fell asleep in his boat , and he slept all night long , while his boat drifted out to the eastward . So , when he awoke in the bright light of morning , he found himself beneath the shadow of Fusan , the Wonder Mountain . His boat lay in the waters of a river of Horaizan , and he steered her amongst the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowering</span> iris and the lotus , and sprang on shore . “ The sweetest spot in the world ! ” he said . “ I think I have come to Horaizan the Blest. ” Soon came the youths and maidens of the island , and with them the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">China</span> , as <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> and as happy as they . “ Welcome , welcome , dear brother , ” they <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ welcome to the Island of Eternal Youth. ” When they had given him to eat of the delicious fruit of the island , they laid them down upon a bank of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> to hear sweet music . Afterwards they wandered in the woods and groves . They rode and hunted , or bathed in the warm sea-water . They feasted and enjoyed every delightful pleasure . So the long day lingered , and there was no night , for there was no need of sleep , there was no weariness and no pain . * * * * * The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> of Japan came to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">China</span> . He said : “ I can not find my boat. ” “ What matter , brother ? ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jofuku</span> . “ You want no boat here. ” “ Indeed , my brother , I do . I want my boat to take me home . I am sick for home . There ’ s the truth. ” “ Are you not happy in Horaizan ? ” “ No , for I have a word written upon my heart . The word is _Humanity_ . Because of it I am troubled and have no peace. ” “ Strange , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">China</span> . “ Once I too had a word written on my heart . The word was _Mutability_ , but I have forgotten what it means . Do you too forget. ” “ Nay , I can never forget , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> of Japan . He sought out the Crane , who is a great traveller , and besought her , “ Take me home to my own land. ” “ Alas , ” the Crane said , “ if I did so you would die . This is the Island of Eternal Youth ; do you know you have been here for a hundred years ? If you go away you will feel old age and weariness and pain , then you will die. ” “ No matter , ” said Wasobiobe , “ take me home. ” Then the Crane took him on her strong back and flew with him . Day and night she flew and never tarried and never tired . At last she said , “ Do you see the shore ? ” And he said , “ I see it . Praise be to the gods. ” She said , “ Where shall I carry you ? ... You have but a little time to live. ” “ Good Crane , upon the dear sand of my country , under the spreading pine , there sits a poor fisherman mending his net . Take me to him that I may die in his arms. ” So the Crane laid Wasobiobe at the poor fisherman ’ s feet . And the fisherman raised him in his arms . And Wasobiobe laid his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> against the fisherman ’ s humble breast . “ I might have lived for ever , ” he said , “ but for the word that is written on my heart. ” “ What word ? ” said the fisherman . “ _Humanity_ is the word , ” the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wise Man</span> murmured . “ I am grown old -- hold me closer . Ah , the pain .... ” He gave a great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cry</span> . Afterwards he smiled . Then his breath left him with a sigh , and he was dead . “ It is the way of all flesh , ” said the fisherman . X REFLECTIONS [ Illustration : Reflections. -- _P . 78._ ] Long enough ago there dwelt within a day ’ s journey of the city of Kioto a gentleman of simple mind and manners , but good estate . His wife , rest her soul , had been dead these many years , and the good <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> lived in great peace and quiet with his only son . They kept clear of women-kind , and knew nothing at all either of their winning or their bothering ways . They had good steady men-servants in their house , and never set eyes on a pair of long sleeves or a scarlet _obi_ from morning till night . The truth is that they were as happy as the day is long . Sometimes they laboured in the rice-fields . Other days they went a-fishing . In the spring , forth they went to admire the cherry <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flower</span> or the plum , and later they set out to view the iris or the peony or the lotus , as the case might be . At these times they would drink a little _saké_ , and twist their blue and white _tenegui_ about their <span class=\"kw-tuned\">heads</span> and be as jolly as you please , for there was no one to say them nay . Often enough they came home by lantern light . They wore their oldest clothes , and were mighty irregular at their meals . But the pleasures of life are fleeting -- more ’ s the pity ! -- and presently the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> felt old age creeping upon him . One night , as he sat smoking and warming his hands over the charcoal , “ Boy , ” says he , “ it ’ s high time you got married. ” “ Now the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> forbid ! ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cries</span> the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Father</span> , what makes you say such terrible things ? Or are you joking ? You must be joking , ” he says . “ I ’ m not joking at all , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> ; “ I never spoke a truer word , and that you ’ ll know soon enough. ” “ But , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> , I am mortally afraid of women. ” “ And am I not the same ? ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> . “ I ’ m sorry for you , my boy. ” “ Then what for must I marry ? ” says the son . “ In the way of nature I shall die before long , and you ’ ll need a wife to take care of you. ” Now the tears <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stood</span> in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> ’ s eyes when he heard this , for he was tender-hearted ; but all he said was , “ I can take care of myself very well. ” “ That ’ s the very thing you can not , ” says his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> . The long and short of it was that they found the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> a wife . She was <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> , and as pretty as a picture . Her name was Tassel , just that , or Fusa , as they say in her language . After they had drunk down the “ Three Times Three ” together and so became <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> and wife , they <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stood</span> alone , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> looking hard at the girl . For the life of him he did not know what to say to her . He took a bit of her sleeve and stroked it with his hand . Still he said nothing and looked mighty foolish . The girl turned red , turned pale , turned red again , and burst into tears . “ Honourable Tassel , don ’ t do that , for the dear <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> ’ sake , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> . “ I suppose you don ’ t like me , ” sobs the girl . “ I suppose you don ’ t think I ’ m pretty. ” “ My dear , ” he says , “ you ’ re prettier than the bean-flower in the field ; you ’ re prettier than the little bantam hen in the farm-yard ; you ’ re prettier than the rose carp in the pond . I hope you ’ ll be happy with my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> and me. ” At this she laughed a little and dried her eyes . “ Get on another pair of _hakama_ , ” she says , “ and give me those you ’ ve got on you ; there ’ s a great hole in them -- I was noticing it all the time of the wedding ! ” Well , this was not a bad beginning , and taking one thing with another they got on pretty well , though of course things were not as they had been in that blessed time when the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> and his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> did not set eyes upon a pair of long sleeves or an _obi_ from morning till night . By and by , in the way of nature , the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> died . It is said he made a very good end , and left that in his strong-box which made his son the richest <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> in the country-side . But this was no comfort at all to the poor <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> , who mourned his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> with all his heart . Day and night he paid reverence to the tomb . Little sleep or rest he got , and little heed he gave to his wife , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mistress Tassel</span> , and her whimsies , or even to the delicate dishes she set before him . He grew thin and pale , and she , poor maid , was at her wits ’ end to know what to do with him . At last she said , “ My dear , and how would it be if you were to go to Kioto for a little ? ” “ And what for should I do that ? ” he says . It was on the tip of her tongue to answer , “ To enjoy yourself , ” but she saw it would never do to say that . “ Oh , ” she says , “ as a kind of a duty . They say every <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> that loves his country should see Kioto ; and besides , you might give an eye to the fashions , so as to tell me what like they are when you get home . My things , ” she says , “ are sadly behind the times ! I ’ d like well enough to know what people are wearing ! ” “ I ’ ve no heart to go to Kioto , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> , “ and if I had , it ’ s the planting-out time of the rice , and the thing ’ s not to be done , so there ’ s an end of it. ” All the same , after two days he bids his wife get out his best _hakama_ and _haouri_ , and to make up his _bento_ for a journey . “ I ’ m thinking of going to Kioto , ” he tells her . “ Well , I am surprised , ” says <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mistress Tassel</span> . “ And what put such an idea into your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> , if I may ask ? ” “ I ’ ve been thinking it ’ s a kind of duty , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> . “ Oh , indeed , ” says <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mistress Tassel</span> to this , and nothing more , for she had some grains of sense . And the next morning as ever was she packs her husband off bright and early for Kioto , and betakes herself to some little matter of house cleaning she has on hand . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> stepped out along the road , feeling a little better in his spirits , and before long he reached Kioto . It is likely he saw many things to wonder at . Amongst temples and palaces he went . He saw castles and gardens , and marched up and down fine streets of shops , gazing about him with his eyes wide open , and his mouth too , very like , for he was a simple soul . At length , one fine day he came upon a shop full of metal mirrors that glittered in the sunshine . “ Oh , the pretty silver moons ! ” says the simple soul to himself . And he dared to come near and take up a mirror in his hand . The next minute he turned as white as rice and sat him down on the seat in the shop door , still holding the mirror in his hand and looking into it . “ Why , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> , ” he said , “ how did you come here ? You are not dead , then ? Now the dear <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> be praised for that ! Yet I could have sworn -- -- But no matter , since you are here alive and well . You are something pale still , but how <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> you look . You move your lips , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> , and seem to speak , but I do not hear you . You ’ ll come home with me , dear , and live with us just as you used to do ? You smile , you smile , that is well. ” “ Fine mirrors , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> gentleman , ” said the shopman , “ the best that can be made , and that ’ s one of the best of the lot you have there . I see you are a judge. ” The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> clutched his mirror tight and sat staring stupidly enough no doubt . He trembled . “ How much ? ” he whispered . “ Is it for sale ? ” He was in a taking lest his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> should be snatched from him . “ For sale it is , indeed , most noble sir , ” said the shopman , “ and the price is a trifle , only two _bu_ . It ’ s almost giving it away I am , as you ’ ll understand. ” “ Two _bu_ -- only two _bu_ ! Now the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> be praised for this their mercy ! ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> the happy <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> . He smiled from ear to ear , and he had the purse out of his girdle , and the money out of his purse , in a twinkling . Now it was the shopman who wished he had asked three _bu_ or even five . All the same he put a good face upon it , and packed the mirror in a fine white box and tied it up with green cords . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Father</span> , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> , when he had got away with it , “ before we set out for home we must buy some gauds for the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> woman there , my wife , you know. ” Now , for the life of him , he could not have told why , but when he came to his home the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> never said a word to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mistress Tassel</span> about buying his old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> for two _bu_ in the Kioto shop . That was where he made his mistake , as things turned out . She was as pleased as you like with her coral hair-pins , and her fine new _obi_ from Kioto . “ And I ’ m glad to see him so well and so happy , ” she said to herself ; “ but I must say he ’ s been mighty quick to get over his sorrow after all . But men are just like children. ” As for her husband , unbeknown to her he took a bit of green silk from her treasure-box and spread it in the cupboard of the _toko no ma_ . There he placed the mirror in its box of white wood . Every morning early and every evening late , he went to the cupboard of the _toko no ma_ and spoke with his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> . Many a jolly talk they had and many a hearty laugh together , and the son was the happiest <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> of all that country-side , for he was a simple soul . But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mistress Tassel</span> had a quick eye and a sharp ear , and it was not long before she marked her husband ’ s new ways . “ What for does he go so often to the _toko no ma_ , ” she asked herself , “ and what has he got there ? I should be glad enough to know. ” Not being one to suffer much in silence , she very soon asked her husband these same things . He told her the truth , the good <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> . “ And now I have my dear old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> home again , I ’ m as happy as the day is long , ” he says . “ H ’ m , ” she says . “ And wasn ’ t two _bu_ cheap , ” he says , “ and wasn ’ t it a strange thing altogether ? ” “ Cheap , indeed , ” says she , “ and passing strange ; and why , if I may ask , ” she says , “ did you say nought of all this at the first ? ” The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> grew red . “ Indeed , then , I can not tell you , my dear , ” he says . “ I ’ m sorry , but I don ’ t know , ” and with that he went out to his work . Up jumped <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mistress Tassel</span> the minute his back was turned , and to the _toko no ma_ she flew on the wings of the wind and flung open the doors with a clang . “ My green silk for sleeve-linings ! ” she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> at once ; “ but I don ’ t see any old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> here , only a white wooden box . What can he keep in it ? ” She opened the box quickly enough . “ What an odd flat shining thing ! ” she said , and , taking up the mirror , looked into it . For a moment she said nothing at all , but the great tears of anger and jealousy <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stood</span> in her pretty eyes , and her face flushed from forehead to chin . “ A woman ! ” she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ a woman ! So that is his secret ! He keeps a woman in this cupboard . A woman , very <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> and very pretty -- no , not pretty at all , but she thinks herself so . A dancing-girl from Kioto , I ’ ll be bound ; ill-tempered too -- her face is scarlet ; and oh , how she frowns , nasty little spitfire . Ah , who could have thought it of him ? Ah , it ’ s a miserable girl I am -- and I ’ ve cooked his _daikon_ and mended his _hakama_ a hundred times . Oh ! oh ! oh ! ” With that , she threw the mirror into its case , and slammed-to the cupboard door upon it . Herself she flung upon the mats , and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> and sobbed as if her heart would break . In comes her husband . “ I ’ ve broken the thong of my sandal , ” says he , “ and I ’ ve come to -- -- But what in the world ? ” and in an instant he was down on his knees beside <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mistress Tassel</span> doing what he could to comfort her , and to get her face up from the floor where she kept it . “ Why , what is it , my own darling ? ” says he . “ _Your_ own darling ! ” she answers very fierce through her sobs ; and “ I want to go home , ” she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cries</span> . “ But , my sweet , you are at home , and with your own husband. ” “ Pretty husband ! ” she says , “ and pretty goings-on , with a woman in the cupboard ! A hateful , ugly woman that thinks herself beautiful ; and she has _my_ green sleeve-linings there with her to boot. ” “ Now , what ’ s all this about women and sleeve-linings ? Sure you wouldn ’ t grudge poor old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> that little green rag for his bed ? Come , my dear , I ’ ll buy you twenty sleeve-linings. ” At that she jumped to her feet and fairly danced with rage . “ Old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> ! old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> ! old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> ! ” she screamed ; “ am I a fool or a child ? I saw the woman with my own eyes. ” The poor <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> didn ’ t know whether he was on his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> or his heels . “ Is it possible that my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> is gone ? ” he said , and he took the mirror from the _toko no ma_ . “ That ’ s well ; still the same old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> that I bought for two _bu_ . You seem worried , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> ; nay , then , smile as I do . There , that ’ s well. ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mistress Tassel</span> came like a little fury and snatched the mirror from his hand . She gave but one look into it and hurled it to the other end of the room . It made such a clang against the woodwork , that servants and neighbours came rushing in to see what was the matter . “ It is my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> . “ I bought him in Kioto for two _bu_. ” “ He keeps a woman in the cupboard who has stolen my green sleeve-linings , ” sobbed the wife . After this there was a great to-do . Some of the neighbours took the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> ’ s part and some the woman ’ s , with such a clatter and chatter and noise as never was ; but settle the thing they could not , and none of them would look into the mirror , because they said it was bewitched . They might have gone on the way they were till doomsday , but that one of them said , “ Let us ask the Lady Abbess , for she is a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wise</span> woman. ” And off they all went to do what they might have done sooner . The Lady Abbess was a pious woman , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> of a convent of holy nuns . She was the great one at prayers and meditations and at mortifyings of the flesh , and she was the clever one , none the less , at human affairs . They took her the mirror , and she held it in her hands and looked into it for a long time . At last she spoke : “ This poor woman , ” she said , touching the mirror , “ for it ’ s as plain as daylight that it is a woman -- this poor woman was so troubled in her mind at the disturbance that she caused in a quiet house , that she has taken vows , shaved her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> , and become a holy nun . Thus she is in her right place here . I will keep her , and instruct her in prayers and meditations . Go you home , my children ; forgive and forget , be friends. ” Then all the people said , “ The Lady Abbess is the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wise</span> woman. ” And she kept the mirror in her treasure . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mistress Tassel</span> and her husband went home hand in hand . “ So I was right , you see , after all , ” she said . “ Yes , yes , my dear , ” said the simple <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young man</span> , “ of course . But I was wondering how my old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> would get on at the holy convent . He was never much of a one for religion. ” XI THE STORY OF <span class=\"kw-tuned\">SUSA</span> , THE IMPETUOUS When Izanagi , the Lord who Invites , turned his back upon the unclean place , and bade farewell to Yomi , the World of the Dead , whither he had journeyed upon a quest , he beheld once more the Land of Fresh Rice Ears , and was glad . And he rested by the side of a clear river that he might perform purification . And Izanagi-no-Mikoto bathed in the upper reach . But he said , “ The water of the upper reach is too rapid. ” Then he bathed in the lower reach ; but he said , “ The water of the lower reach is too sluggish. ” So he went down for the third time and bathed in the middle reach of the river . And as the water dropped from his beautiful countenance there were created three sublime deities -- Ama Terassu , the Glory of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> ; Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami , the Moon-Night-Possessor ; and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , the Lord of the Sea . Then Izanagi-no-Mikoto rejoiced , saying , “ Behold the three august children that are mine , who shall also be illustrious for ever. ” And , taking the great string of jewels from his neck , he bestowed it upon Ama Terassu , the Glorious , and said to her , “ Do Thine Augustness rule the Plain of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> , shining in thy beauty by day. ” So she took the august jewels and hid them in the storehouse of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> . And the Lord of Invitation commanded Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami , saying , “ Do Thine Augustness rule the Dominion of the Night. ” Now this was a youth of a fair and pleasant countenance . And to the youngest of the deities , his Augustness the Lord Izanagi gave the Sea Plain . So Ama Terassu ruled the day , and Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami softly ruled the night . But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , flung himself upon the ground and violently wept , for he said , “ Ah , miserable , to dwell for ever upon the confines of the cold sea ! ” So he ceased not in his weeping , and took the moisture of the valley for his tears , so that the green places were withered and the rivers and streams were dried up . And evil deities increased and flourished , and as they swarmed upon the earth their noise was as the noise of flies in the fifth moon ; and far and wide there arose portents of woe . Then his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> , the Lord of Invitation , came and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stood</span> terribly by him and said , “ What is this that I do see and hear ? Why dost thou not rule the dominions with which I charged thee , but lie here , like a child , with tears and wailings ? Answer. ” And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , answered , “ I wail because I am in misery and love not this place , but would depart to my mother who rules the Nether Distant Land , who is called the Queen of Yomi , the World of the Dead. ” Then Izanagi was wroth and expelled him with a divine expulsion , and charged him that he should depart and show his face no more . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , answered , “ So be it . But first I will ascend to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> to take leave of Her Augustness , my sister , who is the Glory of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> , and then I will depart. ” So he went up to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> with a noise and a great speed , and at his going all the mountains shook and every land and country quaked . And Ama Terassu , the Light of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> , she also trembled at his coming , and said , “ This coming of His Augustness , my brother , is of no good intent , but to lay hold of mine inheritance , and to take it by force . For this alone does he invade the fastness of High Heaven. ” And forthwith she divided the hair that hung upon her shoulders and rolled it in two august bunches to the left and to the right , and adorned it with jewels . So she made her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> like the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> of a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> warrior . And she slung upon her back a great bow and a quiver of arrows , one thousand and five hundred arrows , and she took in her hand a bamboo staff and brandished it and stamped upon the ground with her armed feet , so that the earth flew like powdered snow . So she came to the bank of the Tranquil River of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stood</span> valiantly , like unto a mighty <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> , and waited . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , spoke from the farther bank : “ My lovely sister , Thine Augustness , why comest thou thus armed against me ? ” And she answered , “ Nay , but wherefore ascendest thou hither ? ” And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> replied , “ There is nothing evil in my mind . Because I desired to dwell in the Land of Yomi , therefore has my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> deigned to expel me with a divine expulsion , and I thought to take leave of thee , and so I have ascended hither . I have no evil intention. ” And she , bending her great eyes on him , said “ Swear. ” And he swore , by the ten-grasp sword that was girded on him , and after that he swore by the jewels in her hair . Then she suffered him to cross over the Tranquil River of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> , and also to cross over the Floating Bridge . So <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , entered the dominions of his sister , the Sun Goddess . But his wild spirit never ceased to chafe . And he pillaged the fair lands of Ama Terassu and broke down the divisions of the rice-fields which she had planted , and filled in the ditches . Still the Light of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> upbraided him not , but said , “ His Augustness , my brother , believes that the land should not be wasted by ditches and divisions , and that rice should be sown everywhere , without distinction. ” But notwithstanding her soft words <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , continued in his evil ways and became more and more violent . Now , as the great Sun Goddess sat with her maidens in the awful Weaving Hall of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> , seeing to the weaving of the august garments of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> , her brother made a mighty chasm in the roof of the Weaving Hall , and through the chasm he let down a heavenly piebald horse . And the horse fled hither and thither in terror , and wrought great havoc amongst the looms and amongst the weaving maidens . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> himself followed like a rushing tempest and like a storm of waters flooding the hall , and all was confusion and horror . And in the press the Sun Goddess was wounded with her golden shuttle . So with a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cry</span> she fled from <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> and hid herself in a cave ; and she rolled a rock across the cave ’ s mouth . Then dark was the Plain of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> , and black dark the Central Land of Reed Plains , and eternal night prevailed . Hereupon the voices of the deities as they wandered over the face of the earth were like unto the flies in the fifth moon , and from far and near there arose portents of woe . Therefore did the Eight Hundred Myriad Deities assemble with a divine assembly in the dry bed of the Tranquil River of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> , there to hold parley , and to make decision what should be done . And His Augustness the Lord of Deep Thoughts commanded them . So they called together the Singing Birds of Eternal Night . And they charged Ama-tsu-mara , the Divine Smith , to make them a mirror of shining white metal . And they charged Tama-noya-no-mikoto to string together many hundreds of curved jewels . And , having performed divination by the shoulder-blade of a stag of Mount Kagu , they uprooted a sacred tree , a _sakaki_ , of five hundred branches . And they hung the jewels upon the branches of the tree , and they hung the mirror upon its branches . And all the lower branches they covered with offerings , streamers of white and streamers of blue , and they bore the tree before the rock cavern where the Sun Goddess was . And immediately the assembled birds sang . Then a divine maiden of fair renown , who for grace and skill in dancing had no sister , either in the Land of Rice Ears or upon the Plain of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stood</span> before the cavern door . And there was hung about her for a garland the club moss from Mount Kagu , and her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> was bound with the leaves of the spindle-tree and with <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> of gold and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> of silver , and a sheaf of green bamboo-grass was in her hands . And she danced before the cavern door as one possessed , for <span class=\"kw-tuned\">heaven</span> and earth have not seen the like of her dancing . It was more lovely than the pine-tops waving in the wind or the floating of sea foam , and the cloud race upon the Plain of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> is not to be compared with it . And the earth quaked and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> shook , and all the Eight Hundred Myriad Deities laughed together . Now Ama Terassu , the Glory of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> , lay in the rock cavern , and the bright light streamed from her fair body in rays , so that she was as a great jewel of price . And pools of water gleamed in the floor of the cavern , and the slime upon the walls gleamed with many colours , and the small rock-plants flourished in the unwonted heat , so that the heavenly lady lay in a bower and slept . And she awoke because of the song of the Eternal Singing Birds , and she raised herself and flung the hair back over her shoulder , and said , “ Alack , the poor birds that sing in the long night ! ” And there came to her the sound of dancing and of high revel and of the merriment of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> , so she was still and listened . And presently she felt the Plain of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> shake , and heard the Eight Hundred Myriad Deities as they laughed together . And she arose and came to the door of the cavern , and rolled back the great stone a little way . And a beam of light fell upon the dancing maiden where she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stood</span> , panting , in all her array ; but the other deities were yet in darkness , and they looked at each other and were still . Then spoke the Fair Glory of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> : “ Methought that because I was hidden the Plain of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> should be dark , and black dark the Central Land of Reed Plains . How , then , doth the Dancing Maiden go thus , adorned with garlands and her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> tired ? And why do the Eight Hundred Myriad Deities laugh together ? ” Then the Dancing Maiden made answer : “ O Thine Augustness , that art the sweet delight of all the deities , behold the divine maidens are decked with <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flowers</span> , and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> assemble with shouts . We rejoice and are glad because there is a goddess more illustrious than Thine Augustness. ” And Ama Terassu heard and was wroth . And she covered her face with her long sleeves , so that the deities should not see her tears ; howbeit , they fell like the falling stars . Then the youths of the Court of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stood</span> by the _sakaki_ tree , where hung the mirror that was made by Ama-tsu-Mara , the Divine Smith . And they <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ Lady , look and behold the new paragon of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> ! ” And Ama Terassu said , “ Indeed , I will not behold. ” Nevertheless , she presently let slip the sleeves that covered her countenance and looked in the mirror . And as she looked , and beheld , and was dazzled by her own beauty , that was without peer , she came forth slowly from the rocks of the cavern . And the light of her flooded <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> , and below the rice ears waved and shook themselves , and the wild cherry rushed into <span class=\"kw-tuned\">flower</span> . And all the deities joined their hands in a ring about Ama Terassu , the Goddess of the Sun , and the door of the rock cavern was shut . Then the Dancing Maiden <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ O Lady , Thine Augustness , how should any Deity be born to compare with thee , the Glory of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> ? ” So with joy they bore the goddess to her place . But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Swift , the Brave , the Impetuous , the Long-Haired , the Thrice Unhappy , the Lord of the Sea , him the deities arraigned to stand trial in the dry bed of the Tranquil River of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> . And they took counsel , and fined him with a great fine . And , having shorn him of his hair , which was his beauty and his pride ( for it was blue-black as an iris , and hung below his knee ) , they banished him for ever from the heavenly precincts . So <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> descended to earth by the Floating Bridge with bitterness in his heart , and for many days he wandered in despair , he knew not whither . By fair rice-fields he came , and by barren moors , heeding nothing ; and at last he stayed to rest by the side of the river called Hi , which is in the land of Izumo . And as he sat , moody , his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> on his hand , and looked down at the water , he beheld a chopstick floating on the surface of the stream . So <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , arose immediately , saying , “ There are people at the river head. ” And he pursued his way up the bank in quest of them . And when he had gone not a great way , he found an old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> weeping and lamenting very grievously , among the reeds and willows by the water-side . And there was with him a lady of great state and beauty , like unto the daughter of a deity ; but her fair eyes were marred with many tears , and she moaned continually and wrung her hands . And these twain had between them a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> maid of very slender and delicate form ; but her face <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> could not see , for she covered it with a veil . And ever and anon she moved and trembled with fear , or seemed to beseech the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> earnestly , or plucked the lady by the sleeve ; at which these last but shook their <span class=\"kw-tuned\">heads</span> sorrowfully , and returned to their lamentations . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , full of wonder , drew near and asked the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> , “ Who art thou ? ” And the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> answered , “ I am an earthly deity of the mountains . This is my wife , who weeps with me by the water-side , and the child is my youngest daughter. ” And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> inquired of him again , “ What is the cause of your weeping and lamentation ? ” And he answered , “ Know , sir , that I am an earthly deity of renown , and I was the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">father</span> of eight fair daughters . But a horror broods over the land , for every year at this time it is ravaged by a monster , the eight-forked serpent of Koshi , that delights in the flesh of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> virgins . In seven years have my seven sweet children been devoured . And now the time of my youngest-born is at hand . Therefore do we weep , O Thine Augustness. ” Then said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , “ What is the likeness of this monster ? ” And the deities of the mountain made answer : “ His eyes are fiery and red as the _akakagachi_ ( that is , the winter cherry ) . He has but one body , with eight <span class=\"kw-tuned\">heads</span> and eight scaly tails . Moreover , on his body grows moss , together with the fir and the cryptomeria of the forest . In his going he covers eight valleys and eight hills , and upon his under side he is red and gory. ” Then the Lord <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ My lord , give me thy daughter. ” And the earthly deity , seeing his strength and great beauty and the brightness of his countenance , knew that he was a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">god</span> , and answered , “ With all reverence do I offer her unto thee . Howbeit , I know not thine august name. ” And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> said , “ I am <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Sea <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> , the exile of High Heaven. ” [ Illustration : The Story of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous. -- _P . 99._ ] And the mountain deity and also his fair wife spoke , saying , “ So be it , Thine Augustness , take the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> maid. ” And immediately <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> flung away the veil and saw the face of his bride , pale as the moon in winter . And he touched her on the forehead , and said , “ Fair and beloved , fair and beloved .... ” And the maid flushed faintly to stand thus barefaced . Howbeit , she had little need , for the tears that <span class=\"kw-tuned\">stood</span> in my lord <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> ’ s eyes were veil enough for her modesty . And he said again , “ Dear and beautiful , our pleasure shall be hereafter , now we may not tarry. ” So he took the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">young</span> maid at once , and changed her into a crown for his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> wore the crown gallantly . And he instructed the earthly deity , and together they brewed _saké_ , refined eight-fold ; and with the _saké_ they filled eight vats and set them in readiness ; and when all was prepared they waited . And presently there was a mighty noise , like the sound of an earthquake , and the hills and valleys shook . And the serpent crawled in sight , huge and horrible , so that the earthly deities hid their faces for fear . But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , gazed upon the serpent with his sword drawn . Now the serpent had eight <span class=\"kw-tuned\">heads</span> , and immediately he dipped a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">head</span> into each vat of _saké_ and drank long . Thereupon he became drunken with the distilled liquor , and all the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">heads</span> lay down and slept . Then the Lord <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> brandished his ten-grasp sword , and leapt upon the monster and cut off the eight <span class=\"kw-tuned\">heads</span> with eight valiant strokes . So the serpent was slain with a great slaying , and the river Hi flowed on , a river of blood . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> cut the tails of the serpent also , and as he struck the fourth tail the edge of his august sword was turned back . So he probed with its point , and found a great jewelled sword with a blade sharp as no known smith could temper it . And he took the sword and sent it for an offering to the Sun Goddess , his august sister . This is the herb-quelling sword . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> , the Impetuous , built him a palace at the place called Suga , and dwelt there with his bride . And the clouds of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">heaven</span> hung like a curtain round about the palace . Then the Lord <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Susa</span> sang this song : “ Many clouds arise . The manifold fence of the forth-issuing clouds Makes a manifold fence , For the spouses to be within . Oh , the manifold fence .... ” </div><h1>Experiment: file5</h1>\n",

       "            <div class='highlighted-text'>There was an old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bamboo</span> cutter called <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> . He was an honest old man , very poor and hard-working , and he lived with his good old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> in a cottage on the hills . Children they had none , and little comfort in their old age , poor souls . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> rose early upon a summer morning , and went forth to cut <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bamboos</span> as was his wont , for he sold them for a fair price in the town , and thus he gained his humble living . Up the steep hillside he went , and came to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bamboo</span> grove quite wearied out . He took his blue _tenegui_ and wiped his forehead , “ Alack for my old bones ! ” he said . “ I am not so young as I once was , nor the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">good wife</span> either , and there ’ s no chick nor child to help us in our old age , more ’ s the pity. ” He sighed as he got to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">work</span> , poor <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> . Soon he saw a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> light shining among the green stems of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bamboos</span> . “ What is this ? ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> , for as a rule it was dim and shady enough in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bamboo</span> grove . “ Is it the sun ? ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> . “ No , that can not well be , for it comes from the ground. ” Very soon he pushed his way through the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bamboo</span> stems to see what the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> light came from . Sure enough it came from the root of a great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">big green</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bamboo</span> . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> took his axe and cut down the great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">big green</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bamboo</span> , and there was a fine shining green <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> , the size of his two fists . “ Wonder of wonders ! ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> . “ Wonder of wonders ! For five-and-thirty years I ’ ve cut <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bamboo</span> . This is the very first time I ’ ve found a great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">big green</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> at the root of one of them. ” With that he takes up the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> in his hands , and as soon as he does that , it bursts in two with a loud noise , if you ’ ll believe it , and out of it came a young person and stood on <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> ’ s hand . You must understand the young person was small but very beautiful . She was dressed all in green silk . “ Greetings to you , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> , ” she says , as easy as you please . “ Mercy me ! ” says <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> . “ Thank you kindly . I suppose , now , you ’ ll be a fairy , ” he says , “ if I ’ m not making too bold in asking ? ” “ You ’ re right , ” she says , “ it ’ s a fairy I am , and I ’ m come to live with you and your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">good wife</span> for a little. ” “ Well , now , ” says <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> , “ begging your pardon , we ’ re very poor . Our cottage is good enough , but I ’ m afraid there ’ d be no comforts for a lady like you. ” “ Where ’ s the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">big green</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> ? ” says the fairy . Take <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tori</span> picks up the two halves . “ Why , it ’ s full of gold pieces , ” he says . “ That will do to go on with , ” says the fairy ; “ and now , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> , let us make for home. ” Home they went . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Wife</span> ! <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> ! ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> , “ here ’ s a fairy come to live with us , and she has brought us a shining <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> as big as a persimmon , full of gold pieces. ” The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">good wife</span> came running to the door . She could hardly believe her eyes . “ What is this , ” she said , “ about a persimmon and gold pieces ? Persimmons I have seen often enough -- moreover , it is the season -- but gold pieces are hard to come by. ” “ Let be , woman , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> , “ you are dull. ” And he brought the fairy into the house . Wondrous fast the fairy grew . Before many days were gone she was a fine tall maiden , as fresh and as fair as the morning , as <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> as the noonday , as sweet and still as the evening , and as deep as the night . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> called her the Lady Beaming <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Bright</span> , because she had come out of the shining <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> . Take <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Tori</span> had the gold pieces out of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> every day . He grew rich , and spent his money like a man , but there was always plenty and to spare . He built him a fine house , he had servants to wait on him . The Lady Beaming <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Bright</span> was lodged like an empress . Her beauty was famed both near and far , and scores of lovers came to seek her hand . But she would have none of them . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> and the dear <span class=\"kw-tuned\">good wife</span> are my true lovers , ” she said ; “ I will live with them and be their daughter. ” So three happy years went by ; and in the third year the Mikado himself came to woo the Lady Beaming <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Bright</span> . He was the brave lover , indeed . “ Lady , ” he said , “ I bow before you , my soul salutes you . Sweet lady , be my Queen. ” Then the Lady Beaming <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Bright</span> sighed and great tears stood in her eyes , and she hid her face with her sleeve . “ Lord , I can not , ” she said . “ Can not ? ” said the Mikado ; “ and why not , O dear Lady Beaming <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Bright</span> ? ” “ Wait and see , lord , ” she said . Now about the seventh month she grew very sorrowful , and would go abroad no more , but was for long upon the garden gallery of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> ’ s house . There she sat in the daytime and brooded . There she sat at night and gazed upon the moon and the stars . There she was one fine night when the moon was at its full . Her maidens were with her , and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">good wife</span> , and the Mikado , her brave lover . “ How <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> the moon shines ! ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> . “ Truly , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">good wife</span> , “ it is like a brass saucepan well scoured. ” “ See how pale and wan it is , ” said the Mikado ; “ it is like a sad despairing lover. ” “ How long and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> a beam ! ” quoth <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> . “ It is like a highway from the moon reaching to this garden gallery. ” “ O dear foster-father , ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> the Lady Beaming <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Bright</span> . “ You speak truth , it is a highway indeed . And along the highway come countless heavenly beings swiftly , swiftly , to bear me home . My father is the King of the Moon . I disobeyed his behest . He sent me to earth three years to dwell in exile . The three years are past and I go to mine own country . Ah , I am sad at parting. ” “ The mist descends , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> . “ Nay , ” said the Mikado , “ it is the cohorts of the King of the Moon. ” Down they came in their hundreds and their thousands , bearing torches . Silently they came , and lighted round about the garden gallery . The chief among them brought a heavenly feather robe . Up rose the Lady Beaming <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Bright</span> and put the robe upon her . “ Farewell , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Také Tori</span> , ” she said , “ farewell , dear foster-mother , I leave you my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> for a remembrance .... As for you , my lord , I would you might come with me -- but there is no feather robe for you . I leave you a phial of the pure elixir of life . Drink , my lord , and be even as the Immortals. ” Then she spread her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> wings and the cohorts of Heaven closed about her . Together they passed up the highway to the moon , and were no more seen . The Mikado took the elixir of life in his hand , and he went to the top of the highest mountain in that country . And he made a great fire to consume the elixir of life , for he said , “ Of what profit shall it be to me to live for ever , being parted from the Lady Beaming <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Bright</span> ? ” So the elixir of life was consumed , and its blue vapour floated up to Heaven . And the Mikado said , “ Let my message float up with the vapour and reach the ears of my Lady Beaming Bright. ” XXXVII KARMA [ Illustration : Karma. -- _P . 270._ ] The young man , Ito Tatewaki , was returning homeward after a journey which he had taken to the city of Kioto . He made his way alone and on foot , and he went with his eyes bent upon the ground , for cares weighed him down and his mind was full of the business which had taken him to Kioto . Night found him upon a lonely road leading across a wild moor . Upon the moor were rocks and stones , with an abundance of flowers , for it was summer time , and here and there grew a dark pine tree , with gnarled trunk and crooked boughs . Tatewaki looked up and beheld the figure of a woman before him in the way . It was a slender girl dressed in a simple gown of blue cotton . Lightly she went along the lonely road in the deepening twilight . “ I should say she was the serving-maid of some gentle lady , ” Tatewaki said to himself . “ The way is solitary and the time is dreary for such a child as she. ” So the young man quickened his pace and came up with the maiden . “ Child , ” he said very gently , “ since we tread the same lonely road let us be fellow-travellers , for now the twilight passes and it will soon be dark. ” The pretty maiden turned to him with <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> eyes and smiling lips . “ Sir , ” she said , “ my mistress will be glad indeed. ” “ Your mistress ? ” said Tatewaki . “ Why , sir , of a surety she will be glad because you are come. ” “ Because I am come ? ” “ Indeed , and indeed the time has been long , ” said the serving-maid ; “ but now she will think no more of that. ” “ Will she not ? ” said Tatewaki . And on he went by the maiden ’ s side , walking as one in a dream . Presently the two of them came to a little house , not far from the roadside . Before the house was a small fair garden , with a stream running through it and a stone bridge . About the house and the garden there was a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bamboo</span> fence , and in the fence a wicket-gate . “ Here dwells my mistress , ” said the serving-maid . And they went into the garden through the wicket-gate . Now Tatewaki came to the threshold of the house . He saw a lady standing upon the threshold waiting . She said , “ You have come at last , my lord , to give me comfort. ” And he answered , “ I have come. ” When he had said this he knew that he loved the lady , and had loved her since love was . “ O love , love , ” he murmured , “ time is not for such as we. ” Then she took him by the hand , and they went into the house together and into a room with white mats and a round latticed window . Before the window there stood a lily in a vessel of water . Here the two held converse together . And after some time there was an old ancient woman that came with _saké_ in a silver flagon ; and she brought silver drinking-cups and all things needful . And Tatewaki and the lady drank the “ Three Times Three ” together . When they had done this the lady said , “ Love , let us go out into the shine of the moon . See , the night is as green as an emerald .... ” So they went and left the house and the small fair garden behind them . Or ever they had closed the wicket-gate the house and the garden and the wicket-gate itself all faded away , dissolving in a faint mist , and not a sign of them was left . “ Alas ! what is this ? ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> Tatewaki . “ Let be , dear love , ” said the lady , and smiled ; “ they pass , for we have no more need of them. ” Then Tatewaki saw that he was alone with the lady upon the wild moor . And the tall lilies grew about them in a ring . So they stood the live-long night , not touching one another but looking into each other ’ s eyes most steadfastly . When dawn came , the lady stirred and gave one deep sigh . Tatewaki said , “ Lady , why do you sigh ? ” And when he asked her this , she unclasped her girdle , which was fashioned after the form of a golden scaled dragon with translucent eyes . And she took the girdle and wound it nine times about her love ’ s arm , and she said , “ O love , we part : these are the years until we meet again. ” So she touched the golden circles on his arm . Then Tatewaki <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> aloud , “ O love , who are you ? Tell me your name .... ” She said , “ O love , what have we to do with names , you and I ? ... I go to my people upon the plains . Do not seek for me there .... Wait for me. ” And when the lady had spoken she faded slowly and grew ethereal , like a mist . And Tatewaki cast himself upon the ground and put out his hand to hold her sleeve . But he could not stay her . And his hand grew cold and he lay still as one dead , all in the grey dawn . When the sun was up he arose . “ The plains , ” he said , “ the low plains ... there will I find her. ” So , with the golden token wound about his arm , fleetly he sped down , down to the plains . He came to the broad river , where he saw folk standing on the green banks . And on the river there floated boats of fresh flowers , the red dianthus and the campanula , golden rod and meadow-sweet . And the people upon the river banks called to Tatewaki : “ Stay with us . Last night was the Night of Souls . They came to earth and wandered where they would , the kind wind carried them . To-day they return to Yomi . They go in their boats of flowers , the river bears them . Stay with us and bid the departing Souls good speed. ” And Tatewaki <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ May the Souls have sweet passage .... I can not stay. ” So he came to the plains at last , but did not find his lady . Nothing at all did he find , but a wilderness of ancient graves , with nettles overgrown and the waving green grass . So Tatewaki went to his own place , and for nine long years he lived a lonely man . The happiness of home and little children he never knew . “ Ah , love , ” he said , “ not patiently , not patiently , I wait for you .... Love , delay not your coming. ” And when the nine years were past he was in his garden upon the Night of Souls . And looking up he saw a woman that came towards him , threading her way through the paths of the garden . Lightly she came ; she was a slender girl , dressed in a simple gown of blue cotton . Tatewaki stood up and spoke : “ Child , ” he said very gently , “ since we tread the same lonely road let us be fellow-travellers , for now the twilight passes and it will soon be dark. ” The maid turned to him with <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> eyes and smiling lips : “ Sir , ” she said , “ my mistress will be glad indeed. ” “ Will she be glad ? ” said Tatewaki . “ The time has been long. ” “ Long and very weary , ” said Tatewaki . “ But now you will think no more of that .... ” “ Take me to your mistress , ” said Tatewaki . “ Guide me , for I can not see any more . Hold me , for my limbs fail . Do not leave go my hand , for I am afraid . Take me to your mistress , ” said Tatewaki . In the morning his servants found him cold and dead , quietly lying in the shade of the garden trees . XXXVIII THE SAD STORY OF THE YAOYA ’ S DAUGHTER There was a wandering ballad-singer who came to a great house in Yedo where they wished to be entertained . “ Will you have a dance or a song ? ” said the ballad-singer ; “ or shall I tell you a story ? ” The people of the house bade him tell a story . “ Shall it be a tale of love or a tale of war ? ” said the ballad-singer . “ Oh , a tale of love , ” they said . “ Will you have a sad tale or a merry ? ” asked the ballad-singer . They were all agreed that they would hear a sad tale . “ Well , then , ” said the ballad-singer , “ listen , and I will tell you the sad story of the Yaoya ’ s daughter. ” So he told this tale . * * * * * The Yaoya was a poor hard-working man , but his daughter was the sweetest thing in Yedo . You must know she was one of the five beauties of the city , that grew like five cherry-trees in the time of the spring blossoming . In autumn the hunters lure the wild deer with the sound of the flute . The deer are deceived , for they believe that they hear the voices of their mates . So are they trapped and slain . For like calls to like . Youth calls to youth , beauty to beauty , love to love . This is law , and this law was the undoing of the Yaoya ’ s daughter . When there was a great fire in Yedo , so great that more than the half of the city was burned , the Yaoya ’ s house was ruined also . And the Yaoya and his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> and his daughter had no roof over them , nor anywhere to lay their heads . So they went to a Buddhist temple for shelter and stayed there many days , till their house should be rebuilt . Ah me , for the Yaoya ’ s daughter ! Every morning at sunrise she bathed in the spring of clean water that was near the temple . Her eyes were <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> and her cheeks ruddy . Then she would put on her blue gown and sit by the water-side to comb her long hair . She was a sweet and slender thing , scarce fifteen years old . Her name was O Schichi . “ Sweep the temple and the temple courts , ” her father bade her . “ ’ Tis well we should do so much for the good priests who give us shelter. ” So O Schichi took the broom and swept . And as she laboured she sang merrily , and the grey precincts of the temple grew <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> . Now there was a young acolyte who served in the holy place . Gentle he was and beautiful . Not a day passed but he heard the singing of O Schichi ; not a day passed but he set eyes upon her , going her ways , so light and slender , in the ancient courts of the temple . It was not long before he loved her . Youth calls to youth , beauty to beauty , love to love . It was not long before she loved him . Secretly they met together in the temple grove . Hand in hand they went , her head against his arm . “ Ah , ” she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ that such a thing should be ! I am happy and unhappy . Why do I love you , my own ? ” “ Because of the power of Karma , ” said the acolyte . “ Nevertheless , we sin , O heart ’ s desire , grievously we sin , and I know not what may come of it. ” “ Alas , ” she said , “ will the gods be angry with us , and we so young ? ” “ I can not tell , ” he said ; “ but I am afraid. ” Then the two of them clung together , trembling and weeping . But they pledged themselves to each other for the space of many existences . The Yaoya had his dwelling in the quarter of the city called Honjo , and presently his house was rebuilt which had been destroyed by the fire . He and his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> were glad , for they said , “ Now we shall go home. ” O Schichi hid her face with her sleeve and wept bitter tears . “ Child , what ails you ? ” said her mother . O Schichi wept . “ Oh ! oh ! oh ! ” she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , and swayed herself to and fro . “ Why , maid , what is it ? ” said her father . Still O Schichi wept . “ Oh ! oh ! oh ! ” she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , and swayed herself to and fro . That night she went to the grove . There was the acolyte , very pale and sorrowful , beneath the trees . “ They will part us , ” she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ O my dear heart ’ s desire . The dear gods are angry with us , and we so young. ” “ Ah , ” he said , “ I was afraid .... Farewell , dear maid , O little maid , sweet and slender . Remember we are pledged to one another for the space of many existences. ” Then the two of them clung together , trembling and weeping , and they bade farewell a thousand times . The next day they bore O Schichi home to Honjo . She grew languid and listless . White she grew , white as the buckwheat flower . She drooped and she failed . No longer was she numbered with the five beauties of Yedo , nor likened to a cherry-tree in the time of the spring blossoming . All the day long she brooded silently . At night she lay awake in her low bed . “ Oh ! oh ! ” she moaned , “ the weary , weary night ! Shall I never see him ? Must I die of longing ? Oh ! oh ! the weary , weary night .... ” Her eyes grew large and burning <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> . “ Alas ! poor maid , ” said her father . “ I am afraid ... ” said her mother . “ She will lose her wits .... She does not weep any more. ” At last O Schichi arose and took straw and made it into a bundle ; and she put charcoal in the bundle and laid it beneath the gallery of her father ’ s house . Then she set fire to the straw and the charcoal , and the whole burnt merrily . Furthermore the wood of her father ’ s house took light and the house was burnt to the ground . “ I shall see him ; I shall see him ! ” shrieked O Schichi , and fell in a swoon . Howbeit all the city knew that she had set fire to her father ’ s house . So she was taken before the judge to be tried for her wrong-doing . “ Child , ” said the judge , “ what made you do this thing ? ” “ I was mad , ” she said , “ I did it for love ’ s sake . I said , ‘ I will burn the house , we shall have nowhere to lay our heads , then we shall take shelter at the temple ; I will see my lover. ’ Lord , I have not seen him nor heard of him these many , many moons. ” “ Who is your lover ? ” said the judge . Then she told him . Now as for the law of the city , it was hard and could not be altered . Death was the penalty for the crime of the Yaoya ’ s daughter . Only a child might escape . “ My little maid , ” the judge said , “ are you perhaps twelve years old ? ” “ Nay , lord , ” she answered . “ Thirteen , then , or fourteen ? The gods send you may be fourteen . You are little and slender. ” “ Lord , ” she said , “ I am fifteen. ” “ Alas , my poor maid , ” said the judge , “ you are all too old. ” So they made her stand upon the bridge of Nihonbashi . And they told her story aloud ; they called it from the house-tops so that all might hear . There she was for all the world to look upon . Every day for seven days she stood upon the bridge of Nihonbashi , and drooped in the glare of the sun and of men ’ s glances . Her face was white as the flower of the buckwheat . Her eyes were wide and burning <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright</span> . She was the most piteous thing under the sky . The tender-hearted wept to see her . They said , “ Is this the Yaoya ’ s daughter that was one of the five beauties of Yedo ? ” After the seven days were passed they bound O Schichi to a stake , and they piled faggots of wood about her and set the faggots alight . Soon the thick smoke rose . “ It was all for love , ” she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> with a loud voice . And when she had said this , she died . * * * * * “ The tale is told , ” said the ballad-singer . “ Youth calls to youth , beauty to beauty , love to love . This is law , and this law was the undoing of the Yaoya ’ s daughter. ” * * * * * Transcriber ’ s note : Inconsistent hyphenation ( e.g . hair-pins vs. hairpins ) and variant spellings ( e.g . fulness vs. fullness ) have not been changed .

       "            <div class='highlighted-text'>This is a tale beloved by the children of Japan , and by the old folk -- a tale of magical <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewels</span> and a visit to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> ’ s palace . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince</span> Rice-Ear-Ruddy-Plenty loved a beautiful and royal maiden , and made her his bride . And the lady was called Princess Blossoming- Brightly-as-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees , so sweetly fair was she . But her father was augustly wrath at her betrothal , for his Augustness , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince</span> Rice-Ear-Ruddy-Plenty , had put aside her elder sister , the Princess of the Rocks ( and , indeed , this lady was not fair ) , for he loved only Princess Blossoming-Brightly . So the old King said , “ Because of this , the offspring of these heavenly deities shall be frail , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fading</span> and falling like the flowers of the trees. ” So it is . At this day , the lives of their Augustnesses , the Heavenly Sovereigns , are not long . Howbeit , in the fullness of time , the lady , Blossoming-Brightly-as-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees , bore two lovely men children , and called the elder <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fire Flash</span> and the younger <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fire Fade</span> . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash was a fisherman , who got his luck upon the wide <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> , and ran upon the shore with his august garments girded . And again , he tarried all the night in his boat , upon the high wave-crests . And he caught things broad of fin and things narrow of fin , and he was a deity of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> weeds and of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">waters</span> and of the fishes of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> . But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> was a hunter , who got his luck upon the mountains and in the forest , who bound sandals fast upon his feet , and bore a bow and heavenly-feathered arrows . And he caught things rough of hair and things soft of hair , and he knew the trail of the badger and the wild cherry ’ s time of flowering . For he was a deity of the woods . Now <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> spoke to his elder brother , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash , and said , “ Brother , I am aweary of the green hills . Therefore let us now exchange our luck . Give me thy rod and I will go to the cool <span class=\"kw-tuned\">waters</span> . Thou mayest take my great bow and all my heavenly-feathered arrows and try the mountains , where , trust me , thou shalt see many strange and beautiful things , unknown to thee before. ” But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash answered , “ Not so ... not so. ” And again , after not many days were past , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> came and sighed , “ I am aweary of the green hills ... the fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">waters</span> call me . Woe to be a younger brother ! ” And when <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash took no heed of him , but angled with his rod , day and night , and caught things broad of fin and things narrow of fin , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> drooped with desire , and let his long hair fall untended upon his shoulders . And he murmured , “ Oh , to try my luck upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> ! ” till at last <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash , his elder brother , gave him the rod for very weariness , and betook himself to the mountains . And all day he hunted , and let fly the heavenly-feathered arrows ; but rough of hair or soft of hair , never a thing did he catch . And he cried , “ Fool , fool , to barter the heavenly luck of the gods ! ” So he returned . And his Augustness , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> , took the luck of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> , and angled in sunshine and in gloom ; but broad of fin or narrow of fin , never a fish did he catch . And , moreover , he lost his brother ’ s fish-hook in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> . So he hung his head , and returned . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash said , “ Each to his own , the hunter to the mountain , and the fisherman to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> ... for thou and I have brought nothing home , and this night we sleep hungry . We may not barter the luck of the gods . And now , where is my fish-hook ? ” So <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> replied , saying softly , “ Sweet brother , be not angry ... but , toiling all day with thy fish-hook , broad of fin or narrow of fin , not a fish did I catch ; and , at the last , I lost thy fish-hook in the sea. ” At this his Highness , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash , flew into a great rage , and stamping his feet , required the fish-hook of his brother . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> made answer , “ Sweet brother , I have not thy fish-hook , but the deep <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> , whose bottom no man may search . Though I should die for thee , yet could I not give thee back thy fish-hook. ” But his elder brother required it of him the more urgently . Then <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> burst the wild wistaria tendrils which bound his august ten-grasp sword to his side . And he said , “ Farewell , good sword. ” And he broke it into many fragments , and made five hundred fish-hooks to give to his brother , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash . But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash would have none of them . And again <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> toiled at a great furnace , and made one thousand fish-hooks ; and upon his knees he humbly offered them to his brother , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash . For he loved his brother . Nevertheless <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash would not so much as look at them , but sat moody , his head on his hand , saying , “ Mine own lost fish-hook will I have , that and no other. ” So <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> went grieving from the palace gates , and wandered lamenting by the seashore ; and his tears fell and mingled with the foam . And , when night came , he had no heart to return homewards , but sat down , weary , upon a rock amid the salt pools . And he cried , “ Alas , my brother , I am all to blame , and through my foolishness has this come upon me . But oh , my brother , together were we nursed upon the sweet breast of our mother , Princess Blossoming-Brightly-as-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees , for almost hand in hand did we come into the world. ” And the moon rose so that the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> and the Central Land of Reed Plains was light . But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> ceased not to lament . Then Shiko-Tsuchi-no-Kami , the Lord of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea</span> Salt , came with the rising tide , and spoke , “ Wherefore weeps the Heaven ’ s Sky Height ? ” And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> made answer : “ I have taken my brother ’ s fish-hook , and I have lost it in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> . And though I have given him many other fish-hooks for compensation , he will have none of them , but desires only the original fish-hook . Truly , the gods know , I would give my life to find it ; but how should that serve ? ” And Shiko-Tsuchi-no-Kami took him by the sleeve to where a boat moved upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> , and set him in the boat and pushed it from the shore , saying , “ My son , pursue the pleasant path that Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami , His Augustness , the Moon Night Possessor , has made for thee upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">waters</span> . And , at the end , thou shalt come to a palace made of fishes ’ scales , which is the palace of the great King of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea</span> . Before the gate there is a clear well , and by the well-side there grows a cassia tree with many spreading branches . Therefore climb thou into the branches of the cassia tree , and there wait for the King ’ s daughter , who shall come to give thee counsel. ” And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> , standing up in the boat , made obeisance , and thanked the Lord of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea</span> Salt . But this one girded his august garments and pushed the boat before him , till he was thigh-deep in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> . And he said , “ Nay , nay , fair youth , no thanks , only do my bidding. ” So his Augustness , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> , came to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> ’ s palace . And he forthwith climbed the cassia tree and waited among its green branches . At the day ’ s dawning came the handmaidens of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> ’ s daughter , with their <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewelled</span> vessels , to draw <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> from the well . And as they stooped to dip their vessels , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> leaned and watched them from the branches of the cassia tree . And the glory of his august countenance made a brightness upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">waters</span> of the well . So all the maidens looked up and beheld his comeliness , and were amazed . But he spoke them fairly , and desired of them a little <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> from their vessels . So the maidens drew him <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> in a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewelled</span> cup ( howbeit the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewels</span> were clouded , because of the coldness of the well <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> ) , and they presented it to him with all reverence . Then , not drinking the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> took the royal <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> from his neck , and holding it between his two lips he dropped it into the cup , and the cup he gave again to the maidens . Now they saw the great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> shining in the cup , but they could not move it , for it clung fast to the gold . So the maidens departed , skimming the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> like the white birds of the offing . And they came to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> ’ s daughter , bearing the cup and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> in it . And the Princess , looking at the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> , asked them , “ Is there , perchance , a stranger at the gate ? ” And one of the maidens answered , “ There is some one sitting in the branches of the cassia tree which is by our well. ” And another said , “ It is a very beautiful young man. ” And another said , “ He is even more glorious than our king . And he asked <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> of us , so we respectfully gave him <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> in this cup . And he drank none of it , but dropped a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> into it from his lips . So we have brought them unto Thine Augustness , both the cup and the jewel. ” Then the Princess herself took a vessel and went to draw <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> at the well . And her long sleeves , and certain of the folds of her august garments , floated behind her , and her head was bound with a garland of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> flowers . And coming to the well she looked up through the branches of the cassia tree . And her eyes met the eyes of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> . And presently she fetched her father , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> , saying , “ Father , there is a beautiful person at our gate. ” So the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> came out and welcomed <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> , and said , “ This is the August Child of the Heaven ’ s Sun Height. ” And leading him into his palace he caused the floor to be spread with eight layers of rugs of asses ’ skins , and eight layers of rugs of silk , and set the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince</span> upon them . And that night he made a great banquet , and celebrated the betrothal of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> to his daughter , the fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel Princess</span> . And for very many days there was held high revel and rejoicing in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> ’ s palace . But one night , as they took their ease upon the silken floor , and all the fishes of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> brought rich dishes , and sweetmeats in vessels of gold and coral and jade to set before them , the fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel Princess</span> herself sat at <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> ’ s right hand to pour the wine into his cup . And the silver scales upon the palace walls glittered in the moonlight . But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> looked out across the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea Path</span> and thought of what had gone before , and so heaved a deep sigh . Then the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> was troubled , and asked him , saying , “ Wherefore dost thou sigh ? ” But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> answered nothing . And the fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel Princess</span> , his betrothed wife , came closer , and touched him on the breast , and said softly , “ Oh , Thine Augustness , my sweet spouse , art thou not happy in our <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> palace , where the shadows fall green , that thou lookest so longingly across the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea Path</span> ? Or do our maidens not please thee , who move silently , like the birds of the offing ? Oh , my lord , despise me not , but tell me what is in thine heart. ” Then <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> answered , “ My lovely lady , Thine Augustness , let nothing be hidden from thee , because of our love. ” And he told them all the story of the fish-hook , and of his elder brother ’ s wrath . [ Illustration : The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> and the Magic Jewels. -- _P . 45._ ] “ And now , ” he said , “ will the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel Princess</span> give me counsel ? ” Then the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel Princess</span> smiled , and rose up lightly , and her hair was so long that it hung to the edge and hem of her silken red robe . And she passed to where the palace steps led down into the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> . And standing upon the last step she called to the fishes of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> , and summoned them , great and small , from far and near . So the fishes of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> , both great and small , swam about her feet , and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> was silver with their scales . And the King ’ s daughter cried , “ O fishes of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> , find and bring me the august fish-hook of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash. ” And the fishes answered , “ Lady , the _Tai_ is in misery , for something sticks in his throat so that he can not eat . Perchance this may be the august fish-hook of his Augustness , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire</span> Flash. ” Then the Princess stooped down and lifted the _Tai_ from the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> , and with her white hand she took the lost fish-hook from his throat . And after she had washed and dabbled it for a little , she took it in to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> . And he rejoiced and said , “ This is indeed my brother ’ s fish-hook . I go to restore it instantly , and we shall be reconciled. ” For he loved his brother . But the fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel Princess</span> stood silent and sorrowing , for she thought , “ Now will he depart and leave me lonely. ” And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> hastened to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> ’ s edge , and there bestrode a valiant crocodile , who should bring him to his journey ’ s end . And ere he went , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> spoke : “ Fair youth , now listen to my counsel . If thy brother sow rice upon the uplands , do thou sow thy rice low , in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> meads . But if thy brother sow his rice in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">water</span> meads , then do thou , Thine Augustness , sow thy rice upon the uplands . And I who rule the rains and the floods will continually prosper the labours of Thine Augustness . Moreover , here are two magic <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewels</span> . If thy brother should be moved by envy to attack thee , then put forth the Tide Flowing <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel</span> and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">waters</span> shall arise to drown him . But if thou shouldst have compassion upon him , then put forth the Tide Ebbing <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel</span> , and all the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">waters</span> shall subside , and his life be spared. ” And his Augustness <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> gave thanks with obeisance . And he hid the fish-hook in his long sleeve , and hung the two great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewels</span> about his neck . Then the fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel Princess</span> came near and bade him farewell , with many tears . And the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> charged the crocodile , saying , “ While crossing the middle of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> , do not alarm him. ” So <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> sat upon the crocodile ’ s head ; and in one day he came to his own place and sprang lightly to shore . And unsheathing his dagger , he hung it upon the crocodile ’ s neck for a token . Hereupon , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> found his brother , and gave him back his own fish-hook that had been lost . Nevertheless , because of the two great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewels</span> , which he wore in the folds of his raiment , he had everlasting dominion over his brother , and flourished in all his doings . And , after some time , there came to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> the daughter of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea King</span> , the fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel Princess</span> . And she came across the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea Path</span> bearing in her arms a young child . And she , weeping , laid down the child at the feet of His Augustness and said , “ My lord , I have brought thy son. ” But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> raised her up and made her welcome , and built for her a palace on the seashore , at the limit of the waves . And the palace was thatched with cormorant ’ s feathers . So they dwelt there with the August Child . And the fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel Princess</span> besought her lord , saying , “ Sweet husband , look not on me in the dark night , for then I must take my native shape ; with those of my land it is ever so . Howbeit , look not on me , lest I should be ashamed and misfortune should follow. ” So <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> promised her , and spoke many fair words of assurance . Nevertheless , there came a night when <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> lay awake , and could get no rest . And , at length , when it was very dark , before the dawn , he arose and struck a light to look upon his bride as she slept . And he beheld a great scalèd dragon , with translucent eyes , which was coiled up at the couch ’ s foot . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Prince Fire Fade</span> cried out aloud for terror , and dropped the light . Then morning broke very grey upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> . And at the same instant the great dragon stirred , and from its coils the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel Princess</span> lifted up her lovely head . And the green scales fell away from her like a garment . So she stood , in a white robe , with her child upon her breast . And she hung her head and wept , saying , “ O Thine Augustness , my sweet spouse , I had thought to have made the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea Path</span> a highway between thy land and mine , that we might go and come at pleasure . But now , though I warned thee , thou hast looked upon me in the night . Therefore , my lord , between me and thee it is farewell . I go across the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea Path</span> , and of this going there is no return . Take thou the August Child. ” She spoke , and departed immediately upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sea Path</span> , weeping and covering her face with her hair and looking back to the shore . And she was never more seen upon the Central Land of Reed Plains . Moreover , she shut the gates of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sea</span> and closed the way to her father ’ s palace . But the young maid , her sister , she sent to be a nurse to her babe , and because , for all that had been , she could not restrain her loving heart , she made a little song , and sent it to her lord by the maid , her sister . And the song said : “ Oh , fair are the red <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewels</span> , And fair is the string on which they are strung ... Even so , fair is my babe . But brighter far , and more renowned are the white <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewels</span> , The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewels</span> that are like my lord. ” Then the husband answered , in a song which said : “ As for thee , my lady , whom I took to be my bride , To the island where lights the wild duck -- the bird of the offing , I shall not forget thee till the end of my life . ” </div><h1>Experiment: file6</h1>\n",

       "            <div class='highlighted-text'><span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio Strand</span> is in the Province of Suruga . Its <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sand</span> is yellow and fine , strewn with rose shells at the ebb tide . Its <span class=\"kw-tuned\">pine trees</span> are ancient and they lean all one way , which is the way that the wild wind wills . Before <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio</span> rolls the deep sea , and behind <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio</span> rises Fugi , the most sacred , the mountain of mountains . Small marvel that the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Strange People</span> should come to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio</span> . Of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Strange People</span> not much is known , even at <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio</span> , though it is sure they come there . It seems they are shy indeed , more ’ s the pity . They come through the blue air , or across the mysterious paths of the sea . Their footprints are never , never seen upon the wet beach , for they tread too lightly . But sometimes in their <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dancing</span> they sweep their <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robes</span> upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sand</span> and leave it ribbed and ruffled ; so , often enough , it may be seen at <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio</span> . This is not all . Once a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio</span> set eyes upon a maiden of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Strange People</span> , and talked with her and made her do his bidding . This is a true thing , and thus it came about . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> was out in his boat all night . He cast his net here and he cast his net there , but he caught nothing at all for his pains . It may be believed that he grew weary enough before the morning . In the cold of the dawn he brought his boat to shore and set foot on <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio Strand</span> , shivering . Then , so he says , a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">warm wind</span> met him and blew through his garments and his hair , so that he flushed and glowed . The very <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sand</span> was full of comfort to his chilly feet . Upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">warm wind</span> a fragrance was borne , cedar and vervain , and the scent of a hundred flowers . Flowers dropped softly through the air like bright rain . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> stretched out his hands and caught them , lotus and jessamine and pomegranate . And all the while sweet music sounded . “ This is never <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio Strand</span> , ” cried the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> , bewildered , “ where I have pulled my boat ashore a thousand times or flown kites upon a holiday . Alack , I fear me I have sailed to the Fortunate Isles unawares , or come unwilling to the Sea King ’ s garden ; or very like I am dead and never knew it , and this is Yomi . O Yomi , Land of Yomi , how like thou art to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio Strand</span> , my dear home ! ” After he had said this , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> looked up the beach and down the beach , and he turned and saw Fuji , the mountain of mountains , and then he turned and saw the deep rolling sea and knew he was at <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio</span> and no other place , and gave a long sigh . “ Thanks be , ” he said , and lifting his eyes he saw a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> of feathers hanging upon the branch of a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">pine tree</span> . In the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> were feathers of all the birds that fly , every one ; the kingfisher and the golden pheasant , the love bird , the swan , the crow , the cormorant , the dove , the bullfinch , the falcon , the plover , and the heron . “ Ah , the pretty fluttering thing ! ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> , and he took it from the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">pine tree</span> where it hung . “ Ah , the warm , sweet , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fairy</span> thing ! ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> ; “ I ’ ll take it home for a treasure , sure no money could buy it , and I ’ ll show it to all the folk of the village. ” And off he set for home with the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fairy</span> feathers over his arm . Now the maiden of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Strange People</span> had been playing all this time with the White Children of the Foam that live in the salt sea . She looked up through the cold clear water and marked that her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> hung no longer on the pine-tree branch . “ Alas , alas ! ” she cried , “ my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> , my feather <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> ! ” Swifter than any arrow she sprang from the water , and sped , fleet of foot , along the wet <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sand</span> . The White Children of the Foam followed at her flashing heels . Clad in the cloak of her long hair , she came up with the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> . “ Give me my feather <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> , ” she said , and held out her hand for it . “ Why ? ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> . “ ’ Tis mine . I want it . I must have it. ” “ Oho , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> , “ finding ’ s keeping , ” and he didn ’ t give her the feather <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> . “ I am a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> , ” she said . “ Farewell , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> . “ A Moon <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> , ” she said . “ Farewell , Moon <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> , and he made to take his way along <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio Strand</span> . At that she snatched at the feather <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> , but the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> held fast . The feathers fluttered out and dropped upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sand</span> . “ I wouldn ’ t do that , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> . “ You ’ ll have it all to pieces. ” “ I am a Moon <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> , and at dawn I came to play upon fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio Strand</span> ; without my feathers I can not go back to my place , my home in <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> . Therefore give me my feathers. ” “ No , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> . “ Oh , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> , give me my robe. ” “ I couldn ’ t think of it , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> . At this the maiden fell upon her knees and drooped like a lily in the heat of the day . With her arms she held the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> about the knees , and as she clung to him beseeching him , he felt her tears upon his bare feet . She wept and said : “ I am a bird , a frail bird , A wounded bird with broken wings , I must die far from home , For the Five Woes are come upon me . The red flowers in my hair are faded ; My <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> is made unclean ; Faintness comes upon me ; I can not see -- farewell , dear sight of my eyes ; I have lost joy . Oh , blessed flying clouds , and happy birds , And golden dust in the wind , And flying thoughts and flying prayers ! I have lost all joy. ” “ Oh , stop , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> , “ you may have your robe. ” “ Give , ” she cried . “ Softly , softly , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> . “ Not so fast . I will give you your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> if you will <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dance</span> for me here on <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mio</span> Strand. ” “ What must I <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dance</span> ? ” she asked . “ You must <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dance</span> the mystic <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dance</span> that makes the Palace of the Moon turn round. ” She said , “ Give me my feathers and I will <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dance</span> it . I can not <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dance</span> without my feathers. ” “ What if you cheat me , what if you break your promise and fly immediately to the moon and no <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dancing</span> at all ? ” “ Ah , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> , ” she said , “ the faith of a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> ! ” Then he gave her the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> . Now , when she had arrayed herself and flung back her hair , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> began to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dance</span> upon the yellow <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sand</span> . In and out of the feather <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> crept her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fairy</span> feet . Slowly , softly , she went with folded wings and sang : “ Oh , the gold and silver mountains of the Moon , And the sweet <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Singing Birds</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> ! They sing in the branches of the cinnamon tree , To entertain the thirty kings that are there . Fifteen kings in white garments , To reign for fifteen days . Fifteen kings in black garments , To reign for fifteen days . I hear the music of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> ; Away , away , I fly to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> Places. ” At this the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> spread her rainbow-coloured wings , and the wind that they made fluttered the red flowers in her hair . Out streamed the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">robe</span> of feathers bright and gay . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> laughed . Her feet touched the waves of the sea ; her feet touched the grass and the flowers inshore . They touched the high branches of the pines and then the white clouds . “ Farewell , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">fisherman</span> ! ” the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fairy</span> cried , and he saw her no more . Long , long he stood gazing up into the sky . At length he stooped and picked up a little feather from the shore , a grey dove ’ s feather . He smoothed it out with his finger and hid it in his girdle . Then he went to his home . XVIII THE <span class=\"kw-tuned\">SINGING BIRD</span> OF <span class=\"kw-tuned\">HEAVEN</span> [ Illustration : The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Singing Bird</span> of Heaven. -- _P . 148._ ] Ama Terassu , the Glorious , the Light of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> , commanded , saying , “ His Augustness , my August Child , who is called the Conqueror , shall descend to the land . For it is a Land of Luxuriant Reed Plains , a Land of Fresh Rice Ears , a Land of a Thousand Autumns . So of this land he shall be king. ” Now his Augustness , the August Child , the Conqueror , stood upon the Floating Bridge of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> and looked down , and he saw that there was a great unquietness upon the Land of the Reed Plains . For earthly deities made strife , and blood ran , and fearful sounds of war arose , even to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> . So the August Child , the heavenly born , turned back across the Floating Bridge , and swore he would not descend to rule the land until it should be cleansed . And Ama Terassu , the Light of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> , who had the sun set fast between her eyes , bound her head with jewels , and gathered the deities together in a divine assembly , to hold council in the Tranquil River Bed . And she spoke and said , “ Who shall subdue the land that I have given to the August Child ? ” And all the deities cried , “ O Thine Augustness , send down the Lord of Spears. ” Therefore the Lord of Spears went lightly down by the Floating Bridge ; and there were bound upon his back eight hundred spears . Howbeit , he made a truce with the Lord of the Reed Plains and tarried there ; and for three years there was no report . Therefore , once more the Queen of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> called him whom the gods name Wonderful , and she called the Lord of Deep Thoughts , and likewise she called every deity of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> , and they came to council in the Tranquil River Bed , so that upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sand</span> there was left the print of their august feet . And Ama Terassu said , “ Behold now the Lord of Spears is faithless . Whom shall we send to rule the land ? ” And the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> answered , “ O Mother of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> , Thine Augustness , send me. ” And all the deities assented with one accord and cried , “ Send him , send him , ” till there was a sound like thunder in the River Bed . So the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> bound on his sandals , and they brought to him the great bow that stands in the Hall of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> , and bestowed it upon him , and they gave him many heavenly-feathered arrows . So they made him ready , and they brought him to the Floating Bridge . And the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> descended lightly , while his garments shone with the glory of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> . But when he touched the tops of the high hills , his heart beat fast and his blood ran warm . Therefore he cut the fastening of his sandals and cast them behind him , and he ran upon his bare feet , like an earthly deity , and came to the palace upon the Reed Plains . Now , at the door of the palace the Princess Undershining stood , like a growing flower . So the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> beheld her and loved her , and he built him a dwelling upon the Reed Plains , and took the Princess for his bride . And , because he loved her and her earthly children , he brought no report to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> , and he forgot the waiting deities . For <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> was vague to him as a dream . But the gods were weary . And Ama Terassu said , “ Long , long tarries our messenger , and brings no word again . My Lord , the August Child , waxes impatient ; whom now shall we send ? ” Thereupon , all the deities , and the Lord of Deep Thoughts , replied , “ Send down the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Singing Bird</span> , the beloved of High Heaven. ” So Ama Terassu took the golden <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Singing Bird</span> , and said , “ Sweet music of the divine gods , spread thou thy bright wings , and fly to the Land of Reed Plains , and there search out the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> , the messenger of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> , and , when thou hast found him , sing in his ear this song : ‘ Ama Terassu , the Goddess of the Sun , has sent me saying , How fares the quest of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">High Heaven</span> , and how fares the message ? Where is the report of the gods ? ’ ” So the bird departed , singing . And she came to the Land of the Reed Plains , and perched upon the branch of a fair cassia tree which grew hard by the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> ’ s dwelling . Day and night , she sang , and the gods in <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> thought long for their sweet <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Singing Bird</span> . Howbeit she returned not again , but sat upon the branch of the cassia tree . But the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> gave no heed . And She that Speaketh Evil heard the words that the bird sang . And she whispered in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> ’ s ear , “ See now , my lord , this is an evil bird , and evil is its cry ; therefore take thou thine arrows and go forth and slay it. ” So she urged continually , and , by glamour , she prevailed upon him . Then the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> arose , and took his bow and his heavenly-feathered arrows , and he let fly an arrow into the branches of the cassia tree . And suddenly the sweet sound of singing ceased , and the golden bird fell dead , for the aim was true . But the heavenly-feathered arrow took wing and pierced the floor of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> , and reached the high place , where sat the Sun Goddess , together with her August Counsellors , in the Tranquil River Bed of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> . And the god called Wonderful took up the arrow , and beheld the blood upon its feathers . And the Lord of Deep Thoughts said , “ This is the arrow that was given to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> , ” and he showed it to all the deities . And he said , “ If the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> has shot this arrow at the evil deities , according to our command , let it do him no hurt . But , if his heart be not pure , then let the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> perish by this arrow. ” And he hurled the arrow back to earth . Now the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> lay upon a couch , sleeping . And the arrow fell , and pierced his heart that he died . Yet the sweet <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Singing Bird</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> returned no more ; and the gods were sorrowful . Howbeit , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> lay dead upon his bed ; and the wailing of his spouse , the Princess Undershining , re-echoed in the wind , and was heard in <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Heaven</span> . So the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> ’ s father descended with cries and lamentations , and there was built a mourning house upon the Land of Reed Plains , and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Young Prince</span> was laid there . And there came to mourn for him the wild goose of the river , and the pheasant , and the kingfisher . And they mourned for him eight days and eight nights . </div><h1>Experiment: file10</h1>\n",

       "            <div class='highlighted-text'>Once upon a time there was an old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> who lived all alone . And there was an old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> who lived all alone . The old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> was merry and kind and gentle , with a good word and a smile for all the world . The old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> was sour and sad , as cross a patch as could be found in all the country-side . She grumbled and growled for ever , and would not so much as pass the time of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">day</span> with respectable folk . The old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> had a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">pet sparrow</span> that he kept as the apple of his eye . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> could talk and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sing</span> and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dance</span> and do all manner of tricks , and was very good company . So the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> found when he came <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> from his work at <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> . There would be the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> twittering on the doorstep , and “ Welcome <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> , master , ” he would say , his head on one side , as pert and pretty as you please . One <span class=\"kw-tuned\">day</span> the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> went off to cut wood in the mountains . The old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> , she stayed at <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> for it was her washing <span class=\"kw-tuned\">day</span> . She made some good <span class=\"kw-tuned\">starch</span> in a bowl and she put it outside her door to cool . “ It will be all ready when I want it , ” she said to herself . But that ’ s just where she made a mistake . The little <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> flew over the bamboo fence and lighted on the edge of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">starch</span> bowl . And he pecked at the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">starch</span> with his little beak . He pecked and he pecked till all the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">starch</span> was gone , and a good meal he made , to be sure . Then out came the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> for the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">starch</span> to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">starch</span> her clothes . You may believe she was angry . She caught the little <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> roughly in her hand , and , alas and alack ! she took a sharp , sharp scissors and cut his little tongue . Then she let him go . Away and away flew the little <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> , over hill and over dale . “ And a good riddance , too ! ” said the cruel old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> . When the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> came <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> from the mountains he found his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">pet sparrow</span> gone . And before long he knew all the tale . He lost no time , the good old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> ; he set out at once on foot , calling “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sparrow</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> , where are you , my tongue-cut <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> ? ” Over hill and over dale he went , calling “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Sparrow</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> , where are you , my tongue-cut <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> ? ” At last and at length he came to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> flew out to greet his master . Then there was a twittering , to be sure . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> called his brothers and sisters and his children and his wife and his mother-in-law and his mother and his grandmother . And they all flew out to do the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> honour . They brought him into the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> and they set him down upon mats of silk . Then they spread a great feast ; red rice and _daikon_ and fish , and who knows what all besides , and the very best _saké_ to drink . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> waited upon the good old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> , and his brothers and sisters and his children and his wife and his mother-in-law and his mother and his grandmother with him . After supper the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">danced</span> , whilst his grandmother played the _samisen_ and the good old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> beat time . It was a merry evening . At last , “ All good things come to an end , ” says the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> ; “ I fear ’ tis late and high time I was getting home. ” “ Not without a little present , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> . “ Ah , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> dear , ” says the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> , “ I ’ d sooner have yourself than any present. ” But the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> shook his head . Presently they brought in two wicker baskets . “ One of them is heavy , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> , “ and the other is light . Say , master , will you take the heavy basket or the light ? ” “ I ’ m not so young as I once was , ” says the good old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> . “ Thanking you kindly , I ’ d sooner have the light basket ; it will suit me better to carry -- that is , if it ’ s the same to you , ” he says . So he went <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> with the light basket . When he opened it , wonderful to tell , it was full of gold and silver and tortoise-shell and coral and jade and fine rolls of silk . So the good old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> was rich for life . Now , when the bad old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> heard tell of all this , she tied on her sandals and kilted her skirts and took a stout stick in her hand . Over hill and over dale she went , and took the straight road to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> . There was the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> , and there were his brothers and sisters and children and his wife and his mother and his mother-in-law and his grandmother . They were not too pleased to see the bad old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> , but they couldn ’ t do less than ask her in as she ’ d come so far . They gave her red rice and white rice and _daikon_ and fish , and who knows what besides , and she gobbled it up in a twinkling , and drank a good cup of _saké_ . Then up she got . “ I can ’ t waste any more time here , ” she says , “ so you ’ d best bring out your presents. ” They brought in two wicker baskets . “ One of them is heavy , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrow</span> , “ and the other is light . Say , mistress , will you take the heavy basket or the light ? ” “ I ’ ll take the heavy one , ” says the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> , quick as a thought . So she heaved it up on her back and off she set . Sure enough it was as heavy as lead . When she was gone , Lord ! how the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sparrows</span> did laugh ! No sooner did she reach <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> than she undid the cords of the basket . “ Now for the gold and silver , ” she said , and smiled -- though she hadn ’ t smiled for a twelve-month . And she lifted up the lid . “ _Ai ! Ai ! Kowai ! Obaké da ! Obaké ! _ ” she screeched . The basket was full of ugly imps and elves and pixies and demons and devils . Out they came to tease the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> , to pull her and to poke her , to push her and to pinch her . She had the fine fright of her life , I warrant you . XXXIII THE NURSE [ Illustration : The Nurse. -- _P . 243._ ] <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> the _samurai_ was wedded to a fair wife and had an only child , a boy called <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> was a mighty <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> of war , and as often as not he was away from <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> upon the business of his liege lord . So the child <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> was reared by his mother and by the faithful <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> , his nurse . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> was her name , which is , in the speech of the country , the Pine Tree . And even as the pine tree , strong and evergreen , was she , unchanging and enduring . In the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> there was a very precious <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> . Aforetime a hero of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> ’ s clan slew eight-and-forty of his enemies with this <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> in one battle . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> was <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> ’ s most sacred treasure . He kept it laid away in a safe place with his household gods . Morning and evening the child <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> came to make salutations before the household gods , and to reverence the glorious memory of his ancestors . And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> , the nurse , knelt by his side . Morning and evening , “ Show me the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> , O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> , my nurse , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> . And O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> made answer , “ Of a surety , my lord , I will show it to you. ” Then she brought the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> from its place , wrapped in a covering of red and gold brocade . And she drew off the covering and she took the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> from its golden sheath and displayed the bright steel to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> . And the child made obeisance till his forehead touched the mats . At bedtime O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> sang songs and lullabies . She sang this song : “ Sleep , my little child , sweetly sleep -- Would you know the secret , The secret of the hare o Nennin Yama ? Sleep , my little child , sweetly sleep -- You shall know the secret . Oh , the august hare of Nennin Yama , How augustly long are his ears ! Why should this be , oh , best beloved ? You shall know the secret . His mother ate the bamboo seed . Hush ! Hush ! His mother ate the loquat seed . Hush ! Hush ! Sleep , my little child , sweetly sleep -- Now you know the secret. ” Then O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> said , “ Will you sleep now , my lord <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> ? ” And the child answered , “ I will sleep now , O Matsu. ” “ Listen , my lord , ” she said , “ and , sleeping or waking , remember . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> is your treasure . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> is your trust . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> is your fortune . Cherish it , guard it , keep it. ” “ Sleeping or waking , I will remember , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> . Now in an evil <span class=\"kw-tuned\">day</span> the mother of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> fell sick and died . And there was mourning in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> . Howbeit , when years were past , the _samurai_ took another bride , and he had a son by her and called him Goro . And after this <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> himself was slain in an ambush , and his retainers brought his body <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> and laid him with his fathers . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> was chief of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">House</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> . But the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady Sadako</span> , his stepmother , was ill-pleased . Black mischief stirred in her heart ; she bent her brows and she brooded as she went her ways , bearing her babe in her arms . At <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> she tossed upon her bed . “ My child is a beggar , ” she said . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> is chief of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">House</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> . Evil fortune betide him ! It is too much , ” said the proud <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . “ I will not brook it ; my child a beggar ! I would rather strangle him with my hands .... ” Thus she spoke and tossed upon her bed , thinking of a plan . When <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> was fifteen years old she turned him out of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> with a poor garment upon his back , barefooted , with never a bite nor a sup nor a gold piece to see him on his way . “ Ah , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> mother , ” he said , “ you use me ill. Why do you take my birthright ? ” “ I know nought of birthrights , ” she said . “ Go , make your own fortune if you can . Your brother Goro is chief of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">House</span> of Idé. ” With that she bade them shut the door in his face . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> departed sorrowfully , and at the cross-roads O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> , his nurse , met him . She had made herself ready for a journey : her robe was kilted , she had a staff in her hand and sandals on her feet . “ My lord , ” she said , “ I am come to follow you to the world ’ s end. ” Then <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> wept and laid his head upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> ’ s breast . “ Ah , ” he said , “ my nurse , my nurse ! And , ” he said , “ what of my father ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> ? I have lost the precious <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> is my treasure , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> is my trust , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> is my fortune . I am bound to cherish it , to guard it , to keep it . But now I have lost it . Woe is me ! I am undone , and so is all the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">House</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> ! ” “ Oh , say not so , my lord , ” said O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> . “ Here is gold ; go you your way and I will return and guard the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> of Idé. ” So <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> went his way with the gold that his nurse gave him . As for O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> , she went straightway and took the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> from its place where it lay with the household gods , and she buried it deep in the ground until such time as she might bear it in safety to her young lord . But soon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady Sadako</span> became aware that the sacred <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> was gone . “ It is the nurse ! ” she cried . “ The nurse has stolen it .... Some of you bring her to me. ” Then the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady Sadako</span> ’ s people laid their hands roughly upon O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> and brought her before their mistress . But for all they could do O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> ’ s lips were sealed . She spoke never a word , neither could the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady Sadako</span> find out where the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> was . She pressed her thin lips together . “ The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> is obstinate , ” she said . “ No matter ; for such a fault I know the sovereign cure. ” So she locked O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> in a dark dungeon and gave her neither food nor drink . Every <span class=\"kw-tuned\">day</span> the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady Sadako</span> went to the door of the dark dungeon . “ Well , ” she said , “ where is the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> ? Will you say ? ” But O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> answered not a word . Howbeit she wept and sighed to herself in the darkness -- “ Alas ! Alas ! never alive may I come to my young lord . Yet he must have the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> , and I shall find a way. ” Now after seven <span class=\"kw-tuned\">days</span> the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady Sadako</span> sat in the garden-house to cool herself , for it was summer . The time was evening . Presently she saw a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> that came towards her through the garden flowers and trees . Frail and slender was the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">woman</span> ; as she came her body swayed and her slow steps faltered . “ Why , this is strange ! ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady Sadako</span> . “ Here is O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> , that was locked in the dark dungeon. ” And she sat still , watching . But O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> went to the place where she had buried the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> and scratched at the ground with her fingers . There she was , weeping and moaning and dragging at the earth . The stones cut her hands and they bled . Still she tore away the earth and found the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> at last . It was in its wrapping of gold and scarlet , and she clasped it to her bosom with a loud cry . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Woman</span> , I have you now , ” shrieked the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady Sadako</span> , “ and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> as well ! ” And she leaped from the garden-house and ran at full speed . She stretched forth her hand to catch O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> by the sleeve , but did not have her or the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> either , for both of them were gone in a flash , and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> beat the empty air . Swiftly she sped to the dark dungeon , and as she went she called her people to bring torches . There lay the body of poor O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> , cold and dead upon the dungeon floor . “ Send me the Wise <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Woman</span> , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady Sadako</span> . So they sent for the Wise <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Woman</span> . And the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady Sadako</span> asked , “ How long has she been dead ? ” The Wise <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Woman</span> said , “ She was starved to death ; she has been dead two <span class=\"kw-tuned\">days</span> . It were well you gave her fit burial ; she was a good soul. ” As for the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> , it was not found . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> tossed to and fro upon his lowly bed in a wayside tavern . And it seemed to him that his nurse came to him and knelt by his side . Then he was soothed . O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Matsu</span> said , “ Will you sleep now , my lord <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> ? ” And he answered , “ I will sleep now , O Matsu. ” “ Listen , my lord , ” she said , “ and , sleeping or waking , remember . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> is your treasure . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> is your trust . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> is your fortune . Cherish it , guard it , keep it. ” The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> was in its wrapping of gold and scarlet , and she laid it by <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Fugiwaka</span> ’ s side . The boy turned over to sleep , and his hand clasped the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sword</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Idé</span> . “ Waking or sleeping , ” he said , “ I will remember. ” XXXIV THE BEAUTIFUL DANCER OF YEDO [ Illustration : The Beautiful Dancer of Yedo. -- _P . 250._ ] This is the tale of Sakura-ko , Flower of the Cherry , who was the beautiful dancer of Yedo . She was a _geisha_ , born a _samurai ’ s_ daughter , that sold herself into bondage after her father died , so that her mother might have food to eat . Ah , the pity of it ! The money that bought her was called _Namida no Kané_ , that is “ the money of tears. ” She dwelt in the narrow street of the _geisha_ , where the red and white lanterns swing and the plum trees flourish by the low eves . The street of the _geisha_ is full of music , for they play the _samisen_ there all <span class=\"kw-tuned\">day</span> long . Sakura-ko played it too ; indeed she was skilful in every lovely art . She played the _samisen_ , the _kotto_ , the _biwa_ , and the small hand-drum . She could make songs and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sing</span> them . Her eyes were long , her hair was black , her hands were white . Her beauty was wonderful , and wonderful her power to please . From dawn to dusk , and from dusk to dawn she could go smiling and hide her heart . In the cool of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">day</span> she would stand upon the gallery of her mistress ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , and muse as she stood and looked down into the street of the _geisha_ . And the folk that passed that way said to one another , “ See , yonder stands Sakura-ko , Flower of the Cherry , the beautiful dancer of Yedo , the _geisha_ without peer. ” But Sakura-ko looked down and mused and said , “ Little narrow street of the _geisha_ , paved with bitterness and broken hearts , your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">houses</span> are full of vain hopes and vain regrets ; youth and love and grief dwell here . The flowers in your gardens are watered with tears. ” The gentlemen of Yedo must needs have their pleasure , so Sakura-ko served at feasts every <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> . They whitened her cheeks and her forehead , and gilded her lips with _beni_ . She wore silk attires , gold and purple and grey and green and black , _obi_ of brocade magnificently tied . Her hair was pinned with coral and jade , fastened with combs of gold lacquer and tortoise-shell . She poured _saké_ , she made merry with the good company . More than this , she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">danced</span> . Three poets sang of her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dancing</span> . One said , “ She is lighter than the rainbow-tinted dragonfly. ” And another said , “ She moves like the mist of the morning when the bright sun shines. ” And the third said , “ She is like the shadow in the river of the waving willow-branch. ” But it is time to tell of her three lovers . The first lover was neither old nor young . He was passing rich , and a great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> in Yedo . He sent his servant to the street of the _geisha_ with money in his girdle . Sakura-ko shut the door in his face . “ You are wrong , fellow , ” she said , “ you have lost your way . You should have gone to the street of the toy-shops and bought your master a doll ; let him know there are no dolls here. ” After this the master came himself . “ Come to me , O Flower of the Cherry , ” he said , “ for I must have you. ” “ _Must ? _ ” she said , and looked down with her long eyes . “ Aye , ” he said , “ must is the word , O Flower of the Cherry. ” “ What will you give me ? ” she said . “ Fine attires , silk and brocade , a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , white mats and cool galleries ; servants to wait on you , gold hairpins -- what you will. ” “ What do I give you ? ” she said . “ Yourself , just that , O Flower of the Cherry. ” “ Body and soul ? ” she said . And he answered her , “ Body and soul. ” “ Now , fare you well , ” she said , “ I have a fancy to remain a _geisha_ . It is a merry life , ” she said , and she laughed . So that was the end of the first lover . The second lover was old . To be old and wise is very well , but he was old and foolish . “ Sakura-ko , ” he cried , “ ah , cruel one , I am mad for love of you ! ” “ My lord , ” she said , “ I can easily believe it. ” He said , “ I am not so very old. ” “ By the divine compassion of the gods , ” she told him , “ you may yet have time to prepare for your end . Go <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> and read the good law. ” But the old lover would hear nothing of her counsel . Instead , he bade her to his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> by <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> to a great feast which he had prepared for her . And when they had made an end of the feast she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">danced</span> before him wearing scarlet _hakama_ and a robe of gold brocade . After the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">dancing</span> he made her sit beside him and he called for wine , that they might drink together . And the _geisha_ who poured the _saké_ was called Silver Wave . When they had drunk together , Sakura-ko and her old lover , he drew her to him and cried : “ Come , my love , my bride , you are mine for the time of many existences ; there was poison in the cup . Be not afraid , for we shall die together . Come with me to the Meido. ” But Sakura-ko said , “ My sister , the Silver Wave , and I are not children , neither are we old and foolish to be deceived . I drank no _saké_ and no poison . My sister , the Silver Wave , poured fresh tea in my cup . Howbeit I am sorry for you , and so I will stay with you till you die. ” He died in her arms and was fain to take his way alone to the Meido . “ Alas ! alas ! ” cried the Flower of the Cherry . But her sister , Silver Wave , gave her counsel thus : “ Keep your tears , you will yet have cause for weeping . Waste not grief for such as he. ” And that was the end of the second lover . The third lover was young and brave and gay . Impetuous he was , and beautiful . He first set eyes on the Flower of the Cherry at a festival in his father ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> . Afterwards he went to seek her out in the street of the _geisha_ . He found her as she leaned against the gallery railing of her mistress ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> . She looked down into the street of the _geisha_ and sang this song : “ My mother bade me spin fine thread Out of the yellow sea sand -- A hard task , a hard task . May the dear gods speed me ! My father gave me a basket of reeds ; He said , ‘ Draw water from the spring And carry it a mile ’ -- A hard task , a hard task . May the dear gods speed me ! My heart would remember , My heart must forget ; Forget , my heart , forget -- A hard task , a hard task . May the dear gods speed me ! ” When she had made an end of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">singing</span> , the lover saw that her eyes were full of tears . “ Do you remember me , ” he said , “ O Flower of the Cherry ? I saw you last <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> at my father ’ s house. ” “ Aye , my young lord , ” she answered him , “ I remember you very well. ” He said , “ I am not so very young . And I love you , O Flower of the Cherry . Be gentle , hear me , be free , be my dear wife. ” At this she flushed neck and chin , cheeks and forehead . “ My dear , ” said the young <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> , “ now you are Flower of the Cherry indeed. ” “ Child , ” she said , “ go <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> and think of me no more . I am too old for such as you. ” “ Old ! ” he said ; “ why , there lies not a year between us ! ” “ No , not a year -- no year , but an eternity , ” said Flower of the Cherry . “ Think no more of me , ” she said ; but the lover thought of nothing else . His young blood was on fire . He could not eat , nor drink , nor sleep . He pined and grew pale , he wandered <span class=\"kw-tuned\">day</span> and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> , his heart heavy with longing . He lived in torment ; weak he grew , and weaker . One <span class=\"kw-tuned\">night</span> he fell fainting at the entrance of the street of the _geisha_ . Sakura-ko came <span class=\"kw-tuned\">home</span> at dawn from a festival in a great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> . There she found him . She said no word , but she bore him to his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> outside Yedo , and stayed with him there full three moons . And after that time he was nursed back to ruddy health . Swiftly , swiftly , the glad <span class=\"kw-tuned\">days</span> sped by for both of them . “ This is the happy time of all my life . I thank the dear gods , ” said Flower of the Cherry one evening . “ My dear , ” the young <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> bade her , “ fetch hither your _samisen_ and let me hear you sing. ” So she did . She said , “ I shall <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sing</span> you a song you have heard already. ” “ My mother bade me spin fine thread Out of the yellow sea sand -- A hard task , a hard task . May the dear gods speed me ! My father gave me a basket of reeds ; He said , ‘ Draw water from the spring And carry it a mile ’ -- A hard task , a hard task . May the dear gods speed me ! My heart would remember , My heart must forget ; Forget , my heart , forget -- A hard task , a hard task . May the dear gods speed me ! ” “ Sweet , ” he said , “ what does this song mean , and why do you <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sing</span> it ? ” She answered , “ My lord , it means that I must leave you , and therefore do I <span class=\"kw-tuned\">sing</span> it . I must forget you ; you must forget me . That is my desire. ” He said , “ I will never forget you , not in a thousand existences. ” She smiled , “ Pray the gods you may wed a sweet wife and have children. ” He cried , “ No wife but you , and no children but yours , O Flower of the Cherry. ” “ The gods forbid , my dear , my dear . All the world lies between us. ” The next <span class=\"kw-tuned\">day</span> she was gone . High and low the lover wandered , weeping and lamenting and seeking her both near and far . It was all in vain , for he found her not . The city of Yedo knew her no more -- Sakura-ko , the beautiful dancer . And her lover mourned many many <span class=\"kw-tuned\">days</span> . Howbeit at last he was comforted , and they found for him a very sweet fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> whom he took to wife willingly enough , and soon she bore him a son . And he was glad , for time dries all tears . Now when the boy was five years old he sat in the gate of his father ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> . And it chanced that a wandering nun came that way begging for alms . The servants of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> brought rice and would have put it into her begging bowl , but the child said , “ Let me give. ” So he did as he would . As he filled the begging bowl and patted down the rice with a wooden spoon and laughed , the nun caught him by the sleeve and held him and looked into his eyes . “ Holy nun , why do you look at me so ? ” cried the child . She said , “ Because I once had a little boy like you , and I went away and left him. ” “ Poor little boy ! ” said the child . “ It was better for him , my dear , my dear -- far , far better. ” And when she had said this , she went her way . </div><h1>Experiment: file8</h1>\n",

There was a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> having in her something of earth and something of heaven . She was a king ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">daughter</span> . She was augustly radiant and renowned . She was called the Dear Delight of the World , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Greatly Desired</span> , the Fairest of the Fair . She was slender and strong , at once mysterious and gay , fickle yet faithful , gentle yet hard to please . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">gods</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">loved</span> her , but <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> worshipped her . The coming of the Dear Delight was on this wise . Prince <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Ama Boko</span> had a red <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> of one of his enemies . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> was a peace-offering . Prince <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Ama Boko</span> set it in a casket upon a stand . He said , “ This is a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> of price. ” Then the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewel</span> was transformed into an exceeding fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . Her name was the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the Red <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Jewel</span> , and Prince <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Ama Boko</span> took her to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> . There was born to them one only <span class=\"kw-tuned\">daughter</span> , who was the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Greatly Desired</span> , the Fairest of the Fair . It is true that eighty <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> of name came to seek her hand . Princes they were , and warriors , and deities . They came from near and they came from far . Across the Sea Path they came in great ships , white sails or creaking oars , with brave and lusty sailors . Through the forests dark and dangerous they made their way to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Princess</span> , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Greatly Desired</span> ; or lightly , lightly they descended by way of the Floating Bridge in garments of glamour and silver-shod . They brought their gifts with them -- gold , fair <span class=\"kw-tuned\">jewels</span> upon a string , light garments of feathers , singing birds , sweet things to eat , silk cocoons , oranges in a basket . They brought minstrels and singers and dancers and tellers of tales to entertain the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Princess</span> , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Greatly Desired</span> . As for the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Princess</span> , she sat still in her white bower with her maidens about her . Passing rich was her robe , and ever and anon her maidens spread it afresh over the mats , set out her deep sleeves , or <span class=\"kw-tuned\">combed</span> her long hair with a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">golden comb</span> . Round about the bower was a gallery of white wood , and here the suitors came and knelt in the presence of their liege <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . Many and many a time the carp leapt in the garden fish-pond . Many and many a time a scarlet pomegranate flower fluttered and dropped from the tree . Many and many a time the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> shook her head and a lover went his way , sad and sorry . Now it happened that the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of Autumn went to try his fortune with the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Princess</span> . He was a brave young man indeed . Ardent were his eyes ; the colour flamed in his dark cheek . He was girded with a sword that ten <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> could not lift . The chrysanthemums of autumn burned upon his coat in cunning broidery . He came and bent his proud head to the very ground before the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Princess</span> , then raised it and looked her full in the eyes . She opened her sweet red lips -- waited -- said nothing -- but shook her head . So the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of Autumn went forth from her presence , blinded with his bitter tears . He found his younger brother , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> . “ How fares it with you , my brother ? ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> . “ Ill , ill indeed , for she will not have me . She is the proud <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . Mine is the broken heart. ” “ Ah , my brother ! ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> . “ You ’ d best come home with me , for all is over with us , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of Autumn . But the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> said , “ I stay here. ” “ What , ” cried his brother , “ is it likely , then , that she will take you if she ’ ll have none of me ? Will she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> the smooth cheeks of a child and flout the man full grown ? Will you go to her , brother ? She ’ ll laugh at you for your pains. ” “ Still I will go , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> . “ A wager ! A wager ! ” the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of Autumn cried . “ I ’ ll give you a cask of _saké_ if you win her -- _saké_ for the merry feast of your wedding . If you lose her , the _saké_ will be for me . I ’ ll drown my grief in it. ” “ Well , brother , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> , “ I take the wager . You ’ ll have your _saké_ like enough indeed. ” “ And so I think , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of Autumn , and went his ways . Then the young <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> went to his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> , who <span class=\"kw-tuned\">loved</span> him . “ Do you <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> me , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> ? ” he said . She answered , “ More than a hundred existences. ” “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mother</span> , ” he said , “ get me for my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Princess</span> , the Fairest of the Fair . She is called the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Greatly Desired</span> ; greatly , oh , greatly , do I desire her. ” “ You <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> her , my son ? ” said his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> . “ More than a hundred existences , ” he said . “ Then lie down , my son , my best beloved , lie down and sleep , and I will work for you. ” So she spread a couch for him , and when he was asleep she looked on him . “ Your face , ” she said , “ is the sweetest thing in the world. ” There was no sleep for her the live-long night , but she went swiftly to a place she knew of , where the wistaria drooped over a still pool . She plucked her sprays and tendrils and brought home as much as she could carry . The wistaria was white and purple , and you must know it was not yet in flower , but hidden in the unopened bud . From it she wove magically a robe . She fashioned sandals also , and a bow and arrows . In the morning she waked the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> . “ Come , my son , ” she said , “ let me put this robe on you. ” The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> rubbed his eyes . “ A sober suit for courting , ” he said . But he did as his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> bade him . And he bound the sandals on his feet , and slung the bow and the arrows in their quiver on his back . “ Will all be well , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> ? ” he said . “ All will be well , beloved , ” she answered him . So the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> came before the Fairest of the Fair . And one of her maidens laughed and said : “ See , mistress , there comes to woo you to-day only a little plain boy , all in sober grey. ” But the Fairest of the Fair lifted up her eyes and looked upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> . And in the same moment the wistaria with which he was clothed burst into flower . He was sweet-scented , white and purple from head to heel . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Princess</span> rose from the white mats . “ Lord , ” she said , “ I am yours if you will have me. ” Hand in hand they went together to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> . “ Ah , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> , ” he said , “ what shall I do now ? My brother the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of Autumn is angry with me . He will not give me the _saké_ I have won from him in a wager . Great is his rage . He will seek to take our lives. ” “ Be still , beloved , ” said his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> , “ and fear not. ” She took a cane of hollow bamboo , and in the hollow she put salt and stones ; and when she had wrapped the cane round with leaves , she hung it in the smoke of the fire . She said : “ The green leaves fade and die . So you must do , my eldest born , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">God</span> of Autumn . The stone sinks in the sea , so must you sink . You must sink , you must fail , like the ebb tide. ” Now the tale is told , and all the world knows why <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Spring</span> is fresh and merry and young , and Autumn the saddest thing that is . XXV THE STRANGE STORY OF THE <span class=\"kw-tuned\">GOLDEN COMB</span> [ Illustration : The Strange Story of the Golden Comb. -- _P . 191._ ] In ancient days two _samurai_ dwelt in Sendai of the North . They were friends and brothers in arms . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> one was named , and the other Saito . Now it happened that a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">daughter</span> was born to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> , and upon the selfsame day , and in the selfsame hour , there was born to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> of Saito a son . The boy child they called <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , and the girl they called Aiko , which means the Child of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Love</span> . Or ever a year had passed over their innocent heads the children were betrothed to one another . And as a token the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> of Saito gave a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">golden comb</span> to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> , saying : “ For the child ’ s hair when she shall be old enough. ” Aiko ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> wrapped the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">comb</span> in a handkerchief , and laid it away in her chest . It was of gold lacquer , very fine work , adorned with golden dragon-flies . This was very well ; but before long misfortune came upon Saito and his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , for , by sad mischance , he aroused the ire of his feudal lord , and he was fain to fly from Sendai by night , and his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> was with him , and the child . No man knew where they went , or had any news of them , nor of how they fared , and for long , long years <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> heard not one word of them . The child Aiko grew to be the loveliest <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> in Sendai . She had longer hair than any maiden in the city , and she was the most graceful dancer ever seen . She moved as a wave of the sea , or a cloud of the sky , or the wild bamboo grass in the wind . She had a sister eleven moons younger than she , who was called Aiyamé , or the Water Iris ; and she was the second loveliest <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> in Sendai . Aiko was white , but Aiyamé was brown , quick , and light , and laughing . When they went abroad in the streets of Sendai , folk said , “ There go the moon and the south wind. ” Upon an idle summer day when all the air was languid , and the cicala sang ceaselessly as he swung on the pomegranate bough , the maidens rested on the cool white mats of their <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> ’ s bower . Their dark locks were loose , and their slender feet were bare . They had between them an ancient chest of red lacquer , a Bride Box of their <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> ’ s , and in the chest they searched and rummaged for treasure . “ See , sister , ” said Aiyamé , “ here are scarlet thongs , the very thing for my sandals ... and what is this ? A crystal rosary , I declare ! How beautiful ! ” Aiko said , “ My <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> , I pray you give me this length of violet silk , it will make me very fine undersleeves to my new grey gown ; and , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> , let me have the crimson for a petticoat ; and surely , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> , you do not need this little bit of brocade ? ” “ And what an _obi_ , ” cried Aiyamé , as she dragged it from the chest , “ grass green and silver ! ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Springing</span> lightly up , she wound the length about her slender body . “ Now behold me for the finest <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> in all Sendai . Very envious shall be the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">daughter</span> of the rich Hachiman , when she sees this wonder _obi_ ; but I shall be calm and careless , and say , looking down thus humbly , ‘ Your pardon , noble <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> , that I wear this foolish trifling _obi_ , unmeet for your great presence ! ’ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mother</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> , give me the _obi_. ” “ Arah ! Arah ! Little pirates ! ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> , and smiled . Aiko thrust her hand to the bottom of the chest . “ Here is something hard , ” she murmured , “ a little casket wrapped in a silken handkerchief . How it smells of orris and ancient spices ! -- now what may it be ? ” So saying , she unwound the kerchief and opened the casket . “ A <span class=\"kw-tuned\">golden comb</span> ! ” she said , and laid it on her knee . “ Give it here , child , ” cried the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> quickly ; “ it is not for your eyes. ” But the maiden sat quite still , her eyes upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">golden comb</span> . It was of gold lacquer , very fine work , adorned with golden dragon-flies . For a time the maiden said not a word , nor did her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> , though she was troubled ; and even the light <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">South Wind</span> seemed stricken into silence , and drew the scarlet sandal thongs through and through her fingers . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Mother</span> , what of this <span class=\"kw-tuned\">golden comb</span> ? ” said Aiko at last . “ My sweet , it is the love-token between you and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , the son of Saito , for you two were betrothed in your cradles . But now it is full fifteen years since Saito went from Sendai in the night , he and all his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , and left no trace behind. ” “ Is my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> dead ? ” said Aiko . “ Nay , that I know not -- but he will never come ; so , I beseech you , think no more of him , my pretty bird . There , get you your fan , and dance for me and for your sister. ” Aiko first set the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">golden comb</span> in her hair . Then she flung open her fan to dance . She moved like a wave of the sea , or a cloud of the sky , or the wild bamboo grass in the wind . She had not danced long before she dropped the fan , with a long cry , and she herself fell her length upon the ground . From that hour she was in a piteous way , and lay in her bed sighing , like a maid lovelorn and forsaken . She could not eat nor sleep ; she had no pleasure in life . The sunrise and the sound of rain at night were nothing to her any more . Not her father , nor her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> , nor her sister , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">South Wind</span> , were able to give her any ease . Presently she turned her face to the wall . “ It is more than I can understand , ” she said , and so died . When they had prepared the poor young maid for her grave , her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">mother</span> came , crying , to look at her for the last time . And she set the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">golden comb</span> in the maid ’ s hair , saying : “ My own dear little child , I pray that in other lives you may know happiness . Therefore take your golden token with you ; you will have need of it when you meet the wraith of your lover. ” For she believed that <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> was dead . But , alas , for Karma that is so pitiless , one short moon had the maid been in her grave when the brave young man , her betrothed , came to claim her at her father ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> . “ Alas and alack , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , the son of Saito , alas , my brave young man , too late you have come ! Your joy is turned to mourning , for your bride lies under the green grass , and her sister goes weeping in the moonlight to pour the water of the dead. ” Thus spoke <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> the _samurai_ . “ Lord , ” said the brave young man , “ there are three ways left , the sword , the strong girdle , and the river . These are the short roads to Yomi . Farewell. ” But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> held the young man by the arm . “ Nay , then , thou son of Saito , ” he said , “ but hear the fourth way , which is far better . The road to Yomi is short , but it is very dark ; moreover , from the confines of that country few return . Therefore stay with me , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , and comfort me in my old age , for I have no sons. ” So <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> entered the household of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> the _samurai_ , and dwelt in the garden <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> by the gate . Now in the third month <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> and his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">daughter</span> that was left them arose early and dressed them in garments of ceremony , and presently were borne away in _kago_ , for to the temple they were bound , and to their ancestral tombs , where they offered prayers and incense the live-long day . It was bright starlight when they returned , and cold the night was , still and frosty . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> stood and waited at the garden gate . He waited for their home-coming , as was meet . He drew his cloak about him and gave ear to the noises of the evening . He heard the sound of the blind man ’ s whistle , and the blind man ’ s staff upon the stones . Far off he heard a child laugh twice ; then he heard <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> singing in chorus , as <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> who sing to cheer themselves in their labour , and in the pauses of song he heard the creak , creak of swinging _kago_ that the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> bore upon their shoulders , and he said , “ They come. ” “ I go to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> of the Beloved , Her plum tree stands by the eaves ; It is full of blossom . The dew lies in the heart of the flowers , So they are the drinking-cups of the sparrows . How do you go to your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> ? Even upon the wings of the night wind . Which road leads to your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> ? All the roads in the world. ” This was the song of the _kago_ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> . First the _kago_ of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> the _samurai_ turned in at the garden gate , then followed his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> ; last came Aiyamé of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">South Wind</span> . Upon the roof of her _kago_ there lay a blossoming bough . “ Rest well , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , as she passed , and had no answer back . Howbeit it seemed that some light thing dropped from the _kago_ , and fell with a little noise to the ground . He stooped and picked up a woman ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">comb</span> . It was of gold lacquer , very fine work , adorned with golden dragon-flies . Smooth and warm it lay in the hand of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> . And he went his way to the garden <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> . At the hour of the rat the young _samurai_ threw down his book of verse , laid himself upon his bed , and blew out his light . And the selfsame moment he heard a wandering step without . “ And who may it be that visits the garden <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> by night ? ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , and he wondered . About and about went the wandering feet till at length they stayed , and the door was touched with an uncertain hand . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> ! <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> ! ” “ What is it ? ” said the _samurai_ . “ Open , open ; I am afraid. ” “ Who are you , and why are you afraid ? ” “ I am afraid of the night . I am the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">daughter</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> the _samurai_ .... Open to me for the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> of the gods. ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> undid the latch and slid back the door of the garden <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> to find a slender and drooping <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> upon the threshold . He could not see her face , for she held her long sleeve so as to hide it from him ; but she swayed and trembled , and her frail shoulders shook with sobbing . “ Let me in , ” she moaned , and forthwith entered the garden <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> . Half smiling and much perplexed , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> asked her : “ Are you Aiyamé , whom they call the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">South Wind</span> ? ” “ I am she. ” “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> , you do me much honour. ” “ The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">comb</span> ! ” she said , “ the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">golden comb</span> ! ” As she said this , she threw the veil from her face , and taking the robe of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> in both her little hands , she looked into his eyes as though she would draw forth his very soul . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> was brown and quick and light . Her eyes and her lips were made for laughing , and passing strange she looked in the guise that she wore then . “ The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">comb</span> ! ” she said , “ the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">golden comb</span> ! ” “ I have it here , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> ; “ only let go my robe , and I will fetch it you. ” At this the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> cast herself down upon the white mats in a passion of bitter tears , and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , poor unfortunate , pressed his hands together , quite beside himself . “ What to do ? ” he said ; “ what to do ? ” At last he raised the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> in his arms , and stroked her little hand to comfort her . “ Lord , ” she said , as simply as a child , “ lord , do you <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> me ? ” And he answered her in a moment , “ I <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> you more than many lives , O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the South Wind. ” “ Lord , ” she said , “ will you come with me then ? ” He answered her , “ Even to the land of Yomi , ” and took her hand . Forth they went into the night , and they took the road together . By river-side they went , and over plains of flowers ; they went by rocky ways , or through the whispering pines , and when they had wandered far enough , of the green bamboos they built them a little <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> to dwell in . And they were there for a year of happy days and nights . Now upon a morning of the third month <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> beheld <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> with _kago_ come swinging through the bamboo grove . And he said : “ What have they to do with us , these <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> and their _kago_ ? ” “ Lord , ” said Aiyamé , “ they come to bear us to my father ’ s house. ” He cried , “ What is this foolishness ? We will not go. ” “ Indeed , and we must go , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . “ Go you , then , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> ; “ as for me , I stay here where I am happy. ” “ Ah , lord , ” she said , “ ah , my dear , do you then <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> me less , who vowed to go with me , even to the Land of Yomi ? ” Then he did all that she would . And he broke a blossoming bough from a tree that grew near by and laid it upon the roof of her _kago_ . Swiftly , swiftly they were borne , and the _kago_ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> sang as they went , a song to make labour light . “ I go to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> of the Beloved , Her plum tree stands by the eaves ; It is full of blossom . The dew lies in the heart of the flowers , So they are the drinking-cups of the sparrows . How do you go to your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> ? Even upon the wings of the night wind . Which road leads to your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> ? All the roads in the world. ” This was the song of the _kago_ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">men</span> . About nightfall they came to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> the _samurai_ . “ Go you in , my dear lord , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">South Wind</span> . “ I will wait without ; if my father is very wroth with you , only show him the golden comb. ” And with that she took it from her hair and gave it him . Smooth and warm it lay in his hand . Then <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> went into the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> . “ Welcome , welcome home , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , son of Saito ! ” cried <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> . “ How has it fared with your knightly adventure ? ” “ Knightly adventure ! ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , and blushed . “ It is a year since your sudden departure , and we supposed that you had gone upon a quest , or in the expiation of some vow laid upon your soul. ” “ Alas , my good lord , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , “ I have sinned against you and against your house. ” And he told <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> what he had done . When he had made an end of his tale : “ Boy , ” said the _samurai_ , “ you jest , but your merry jest is ill-timed . Know that my child lies even as one dead . For a year she has neither risen nor spoken nor smiled . She is visited by a heavy sickness and none can heal her. ” “ Sir , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , “ your child , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">South Wind</span> , waits in a _kago_ without your garden wall . I will fetch her in presently. ” Forth they went together , the young man and the _samurai_ , but they found no _kago_ without the garden wall , no _kago_-bearers and no <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . Only a broken bough of withered blossom lay upon the ground . “ Indeed , indeed , she was here but now ! ” cried <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> . “ She gave me her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">comb</span> -- her <span class=\"kw-tuned\">golden comb</span> . See , my lord , here it is. ” “ What <span class=\"kw-tuned\">comb</span> is this , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> ? Where got you this <span class=\"kw-tuned\">comb</span> that was set in a dead maid ’ s hair , and buried with her beneath the green grass ? Where got you the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">comb</span> of Aiko , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the Moon , that died for <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> ? Speak , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> , son of Saito . This is a strange thing. ” Now whilst <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> stood amazed , and leaned silent and bewildered against the garden wall , a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> came lightly through the trees . She moved as a wave of the sea , or a cloud of the sky , or the wild bamboo grass in the wind . “ Aiyamé , ” cried the _samurai_ , “ how are you able to leave your bed ? ” The young man said nothing , but fell on his knees beside the garden wall . There the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> came to him and bent so that her hair and her garments overshadowed him , and her eyes held his . “ Lord , ” she said , “ I am the spirit of Aiko your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> . I went with a broken heart to dwell with the shades of Yomi . The very dead took pity on my tears . I was permitted to return , and for one short year to inhabit the sweet body of my sister . And now my time is come . I go my ways to the grey country . I shall be the happiest soul in Yomi -- I have known you , beloved . Now take me in your arms , for I grow very faint. ” With that she sank to the ground , and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> put his arms about her and laid her head against his heart . His tears fell upon her forehead . “ Promise me , ” she said , “ that you will take to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">wife</span> Aiyamé , my sister , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the South Wind. ” “ Ah , ” he cried , “ my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> and my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> ! ” “ Promise , promise , ” she said . Then he promised . After a little she stirred in his arms . “ What is it ? ” he said . So soft her voice that it did not break the silence but floated upon it . “ The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">comb</span> , ” she murmured , “ the golden comb. ” And <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> set it in her hair . * * * * * A burden , pale but breathing , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> carried into the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> of <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hasunuma</span> and laid upon the white mats and silken cushions . And after three hours a young maid sat up and rubbed her sleepy eyes . She was brown and quick and light and laughing . Her hair was tumbled about her rosy cheeks , unconfined by any braid or <span class=\"kw-tuned\">comb</span> . She stared first at her father , and then at the young man that was in her bower . She smiled , then flushed , and put her little hands before her face . “ Greeting , O <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">South Wind</span> , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Konojo</span> . </div><h1>Experiment: file9</h1>\n",

       "            <div class='highlighted-text'>Long ago , as I ’ ve heard tell , there dwelt at the temple of Morinji , in the Province of Kotsuke , a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">holy</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">priest</span> . Now there were three things about this reverend <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> . First , he was wrapped up in meditations and observances and forms and doctrines . He was a great one for the Sacred Sutras , and knew strange and mystical things . Then he had a fine exquisite taste of his own , and nothing pleased him so much as the ancient tea ceremony of the _Cha-no-yu_ ; and for the third thing about him , he knew both sides of a copper coin well enough and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">loved</span> a bargain . None so pleased as he when he happened upon an ancient <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> , lying rusty and dirty and half-forgotten in a corner of a poor shop in a back street of his town . “ An ugly bit of old metal , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">holy man</span> to the shopkeeper ; “ but it will do well enough to boil my humble drop of water of an evening . I ’ ll give you three _rin_ for it. ” This he did and took the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> home , rejoicing ; for it was of bronze , fine work , the very thing for the _Cha-no-yu_ . A <span class=\"kw-tuned\">novice</span> cleaned and scoured the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> , and it came out as pretty as you please . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">priest</span> turned it this way and that , and upside down , looked into it , tapped it with his finger-nail . He smiled . “ A bargain , ” he <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ a bargain ! ” and rubbed his hands . He set the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> upon a box covered over with a purple cloth , and looked at it so long that first he was fain to rub his eyes many times , and then to close them altogether . His head dropped forward and he slept . And then , believe me , the wonderful thing happened . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> moved , though no hand was near it . A hairy head , with two <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright eyes</span> , looked out of the spout . The lid jumped up and down . Four brown and hairy paws appeared , and a fine bushy tail . In a minute the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> was down from the box and going round and round looking at things . “ A very comfortable room , to be sure , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> . Pleased enough to find itself so well lodged , it soon began to dance and to caper nimbly and to sing at the top of its voice . Three or four <span class=\"kw-tuned\">novices</span> were studying in the next room . “ The old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> is lively , ” they said ; “ only hark to him . What can he be at ? ” And they laughed in their sleeves . Heaven ’ s mercy , the noise that the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> made ! Bang ! bang ! Thud ! thud ! thud ! The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">novices</span> soon stopped laughing . One of them slid aside the _kara-kami_ and peeped through . “ Arah , the devil and all ’ s in it ! ” he <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> . “ Here ’ s the master ’ s old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> turned into a sort of a badger . The gods protect us from witchcraft , or for certain we shall be lost ! ” “ And I scoured it not an hour since , ” said another <span class=\"kw-tuned\">novice</span> , and he fell to reciting the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Holy</span> Sutras on his knees . A third laughed . “ I ’ m for a nearer view of the hobgoblin , ” he said . So the lot of them left their books in a twinkling , and gave chase to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> to catch it . But could they come up with the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> ? Not a bit of it . It danced and it leapt and it flew up into the air . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">novices</span> rushed here and there , slipping upon the mats . They grew hot . They grew breathless . “ Ha , ha ! Ha , ha ! ” laughed the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> ; and “ Catch me if you can ! ” laughed the wonderful <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> . Presently the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">priest</span> awoke , all rosy , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">holy man</span> . “ And what ’ s the meaning of this racket , ” he says , “ disturbing me at my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">holy</span> meditations and all ? ” “ Master , master , ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cry</span> the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">novices</span> , panting and mopping their brows , “ your <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> is bewitched . It was a badger , no less . And the dance it has been giving us , you ’ d never believe ! ” “ Stuff and nonsense , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">priest</span> ; “ bewitched ? Not a bit of it . There it rests on its box , good quiet thing , just where I put it. ” Sure enough , so it did , looking as hard and cold and innocent as you please . There was not a hair of a badger near it . It was the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">novices</span> that looked foolish . “ A likely story indeed , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">priest</span> . “ I have heard of the pestle that took wings to itself and flew away , parting company with the mortar . That is easily to be understood by any <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> . But a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> that turned into a badger -- no , no ! To your books , my sons , and pray to be preserved from the perils of illusion. ” That very night the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">holy man</span> filled the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> with water from the spring and set it on the _hibachi_ to boil for his cup of tea . When the water began to boil -- “ Ai ! Ai ! ” the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> ; “ Ai ! Ai ! The heat of the Great Hell ! ” And it lost no time at all , but hopped off the fire as quick as you please . “ Sorcery ! ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">priest</span> . “ Black magic ! A devil ! A devil ! A devil ! Mercy on me ! Help ! Help ! Help ! ” He was frightened out of his wits , the dear good <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> . All the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">novices</span> came running to see what was the matter . “ The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> is bewitched , ” he gasped ; “ it was a badger , assuredly it was a badger ... it both speaks and leaps about the room. ” “ Nay , master , ” said a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">novice</span> , “ see where it rests upon its box , good quiet thing. ” And sure enough , so it did . “ Most reverend sir , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">novice</span> , “ let us all pray to be preserved from the perils of illusion. ” The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">priest</span> sold the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> to a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> and got for it twenty copper coins . “ It ’ s a mighty fine bit of bronze , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">priest</span> . “ Mind , I ’ m giving it away to you , I ’ m sure I can not tell what for. ” Ah , he was the one for a bargain ! The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> was a happy <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> and carried home the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> . He turned it this way and that , and upside down , and looked into it . “ A pretty piece , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> ; “ a very good bargain. ” And when he went to bed that night he put the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> by him , to see it first thing in the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">morning</span> . He awoke at midnight and fell to looking at the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> by the bright light of the moon . Presently it moved , though there was no hand near it . “ Strange , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> ; but he was a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> who took things as they came . A hairy head , with two <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright eyes</span> , looked out of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> ’ s spout . The lid jumped up and down . Four brown and hairy paws appeared , and a fine bushy tail . It came quite close to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> and laid a paw upon him . “ Well ? ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ I am not wicked , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> . “ No , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ But I like to be well treated . I am a badger tea-kettle. ” “ So it seems , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ At the temple they called me names , and beat me and set me on the fire . I couldn ’ t stand it , you know. ” “ I like your spirit , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ I think I shall settle down with you. ” “ Shall I keep you in a lacquer box ? ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ Not a bit of it , keep me with you ; let us have a talk now and again . I am very fond of a pipe . I like rice to eat , and beans and sweet things. ” “ A cup of _saké_ sometimes ? ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ Well , yes , now you mention it. ” “ I ’ m willing , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ Thank you kindly , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> ; “ and , as a beginning , would you object to my sharing your bed ? The night has turned a little chilly. ” “ Not the least in the world , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> and the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> became the best of friends . They ate and talked together . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> knew a thing or two and was very good company . One day : “ Are you poor ? ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> . “ Yes , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> , “ middling poor. ” “ Well , I have a happy thought . For a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> , I am out-of-the-way -- really very accomplished. ” “ I believe you , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ My name is _Bumbuku-Chagama_ ; I am the very prince of Badger Tea-Kettles. ” “ Your servant , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ If you ’ ll take my advice , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> , “ you ’ ll carry me round as a show ; I really am out-of-the-way , and it ’ s my opinion you ’ d make a mint of money. ” “ That would be hard work for you , my dear _Bumbuku_ , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ Not at all ; let us start forthwith , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> . So they did . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> bought hangings for a theatre , and he called the show _Bumbuku-Chagama_ . How the people flocked to see the fun ! For the wonderful and most accomplished <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> danced and sang , and walked the tight rope as to the manner born . It played such tricks and had such droll ways that the people laughed till their sides ached . It was a treat to see the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> bow as gracefully as a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> and thank the people for their patience . The _Bumbuku-Chagama_ was the talk of the country-side , and all the gentry came to see it as well as the commonalty . As for the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> , he waved a fan and took the money . You may believe that he grew fat and rich . He even went to Court , where the great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">ladies</span> and the royal princesses made much of the wonderful <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> . At last the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> retired from business , and to him the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> came with tears in its <span class=\"kw-tuned\">bright eyes</span> . “ I ’ m much afraid it ’ s time to leave you , ” it says . “ Now , don ’ t say that , _Bumbuku_ , dear , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> . “ We ’ ll be so happy together now we are rich. ” “ I ’ ve come to the end of my time , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> . “ You ’ ll not see old _Bumbuku_ any more ; henceforth I shall be an ordinary <span class=\"kw-tuned\">kettle</span> , nothing more or less. ” “ Oh , my dear _Bumbuku_ , what shall I do ? ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> the poor <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> in tears . “ I think I should like to be given to the temple of Morinji , as a very sacred treasure , ” says the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> . It never spoke or moved again . So the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tinker</span> presented it as a very sacred treasure to the temple , and the half of his wealth with it . And the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">tea-kettle</span> was held in wondrous fame for many a long year . Some persons even worshipped it as a saint . IV THE PEONY LANTERN [ Illustration : The Peony Lantern. -- _P . 25._ ] In Yedo there dwelt a _samurai_ called <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> . He was a _samurai_ of the _hatamoto_ , which is of all the ranks of _samurai_ the most honourable . He possessed a noble figure and a very beautiful face , and was beloved of many a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> of Yedo , both openly and in secret . For himself , being yet very young , his thoughts turned to pleasure rather than to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> , and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">morning</span> , noon and night he was wont to disport himself with the gay youth of the city . He was the prince and leader of joyous revels within doors and without , and would often parade the streets for long together with bands of his boon companions . One bright and wintry day during the Festival of the New Year he found himself with a company of laughing youths and maidens playing at battledore and shuttlecock . He had wandered far away from his own quarter of the city , and was now in a suburb quite the other side of Yedo , where the streets were empty , more or less , and the quiet <span class=\"kw-tuned\">houses</span> stood in gardens . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> wielded his heavy battledore with great skill and grace , catching the gilded shuttlecock and tossing it lightly into the air ; but at length with a careless or an ill-judged stroke , he sent it flying over the heads of the players , and over the bamboo fence of a garden near by . Immediately he started after it . Then his companions <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ Stay , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> ; here we have more than a dozen shuttlecocks. ” “ Nay , ” he said , “ but this was dove-coloured and gilded. ” “ Foolish one ! ” answered his friends ; “ here we have six shuttlecocks all dove-coloured and gilded. ” But he paid them no heed , for he had become full of a very strange desire for the shuttlecock he had lost . He scaled the bamboo fence and dropped into the garden which was upon the farther side . Now he had marked the very spot where the shuttlecock should have fallen , but it was not there ; so he searched along the foot of the bamboo fence -- but no , he could not find it . Up and down he went , beating the bushes with his battledore , his eyes on the ground , drawing breath heavily as if he had lost his dearest treasure . His friends called him , but he did not come , and they grew tired and went to their own homes . The light of day began to fail . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> , the _samurai_ , looked up and saw a girl standing a few yards away from him . She beckoned him with her right hand , and in her left she held a gilded shuttlecock with dove-coloured feathers . The _samurai_ shouted joyfully and ran forward . Then the girl drew away from him , still beckoning him with the right hand . The shuttlecock lured him , and he followed . So they went , the two of them , till they came to the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> that was in the garden , and three stone steps that led up to it . Beside the lowest step there grew a plum tree in blossom , and upon the highest step there stood a fair and very young <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . She was most splendidly attired in robes of high festival . Her _kimono_ was of water-blue silk , with sleeves of ceremony so long that they touched the ground ; her under-dress was scarlet , and her great girdle of brocade was stiff and heavy with gold . In her hair were pins of gold and tortoiseshell and coral . When <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> saw the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> , he knelt down forthwith and made her due obeisance , till his forehead touched the ground . Then the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> spoke , smiling with pleasure like a child . “ Come into my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara Sama</span> , _samurai_ of the _hatamoto_ . I am O ’ Tsuyu , the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Morning Dew</span> . My dear handmaiden , O ’ Yoné , has brought you to me . Come in , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara Sama</span> , _samurai_ of the _hatamoto_ ; for indeed I am glad to see you , and happy is this hour. ” So the _samurai_ went in , and they brought him to a room of ten mats , where they entertained him ; for the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Morning Dew</span> danced before him in the ancient manner , whilst O ’ Yoné , the handmaiden , beat upon a small scarlet-tasselled drum . Afterwards they set food before him , the red rice of the festival and sweet warm wine , and he ate and drank of the food they gave him . It was dark night when <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> took his leave . “ Come again , honourable <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> , come again , ” said O ’ Yoné the handmaiden . “ Yea , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> , you needs must come , ” whispered the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Morning Dew</span> . The _samurai_ laughed . “ And if I do not come ? ” he said mockingly . “ What if I do not come ? ” The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> stiffened , and her child ’ s face grew grey , but she laid her hand upon <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> ’ s shoulder . “ Then , ” she said , “ it will be death , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> . Death it will be for you and for me . There is no other way. ” O ’ Yoné shuddered and hid her eyes with her sleeve . The _samurai_ went out into the night , being very much afraid . Long , long he sought for his home and could not find it , wandering in the black darkness from end to end of the sleeping city . When at last he reached his familiar door the late dawn was almost come , and wearily he threw himself upon his bed . Then he laughed . “ After all , I have left behind me my shuttlecock , ” said <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> the _samurai_ . The next day <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> sat alone in his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> from <span class=\"kw-tuned\">morning</span> till evening . He had his hands before him ; and he thought , but did nothing more . At the end of the time he said , “ It is a joke that a couple of _geisha_ have sought to play on me . Excellent , in faith , but they shall not have me ! ” So he dressed himself in his best and went forth to join his friends . For five or six days he was at joustings and junketings , the gayest of the gay . His wit was ready , his spirits were wild . Then he said , “ By the gods , I am deathly sick of this , ” and took to walking the streets of Yedo alone . From end to end of the great city he went . He wandered by day and he wandered by night , by street and alley he went , by hill and moat and castle wall , but he found not what he sought . He could not come upon the garden where his shuttlecock was lost , nor yet upon the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Morning Dew</span> . His spirit had no rest . He fell sick and took to his bed , where he neither ate nor slept , but grew spectre-thin . This was about the third month . In the sixth month , at the time of _niubai_ , the hot and rainy season , he rose up , and , in spite of all his faithful servant could say or do to dissuade him , he wrapped a loose summer robe about him and at once went forth . “ Alack ! Alack ! ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> the servant , “ the youth has the fever , or he is perchance mad. ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> faltered not at all . He looked neither to the right nor to the left . Straight forward he went , for he said to himself , “ All roads lead past my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> ’ s house. ” Soon he came to a quiet suburb , and to a certain <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> whose garden had a split bamboo fence . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> laughed softly and scaled the fence . “ The same , the very same shall be the manner of our meeting , ” he said . He found the garden wild and overgrown . Moss covered the three stone steps . The plum tree that grew there fluttered its green leaves disconsolate . The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> was still , its shutters were all closed , it was forlorn and deserted . The _samurai_ grew cold as he stood and wondered . A soaking rain fell . There came an old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> into the garden . He said to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> : “ Sir , what do you do here ? ” “ The white flower has fallen from the plum tree , ” said the _samurai_ . “ Where is the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Morning Dew</span> ? ” “ She is dead , ” answered the old <span class=\"kw-tuned\">man</span> ; “ dead these five or six moons , of a strange and sudden sickness . She lies in the graveyard on the hill , and O ’ Yoné , her handmaid , lies by her side . She could not suffer her mistress to wander alone through the long night of Yomi . For their sweet spirits ’ sake I would still tend this garden , but I am old and it is little that I can do . Oh , sir , they are dead indeed . The grass grows on their graves. ” <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> went to his own home . He took a slip of pure white wood and he wrote upon it , in large fair characters , the dear name of his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> . This he set up , and burned before it incense and sweet odours , and made every offering that was meet , and did due observance , and all for the welfare of her departed spirit . Then drew near the Festival of _Bon_ , the time of returning souls . The good folk of Yedo took lanterns and visited their graves . Bringing food and flowers , they cared for their beloved dead . On the thirteenth day of the seventh month , which , in the _Bon_ , is the day of days , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> the _samurai_ walked in his garden by night for the sake of the coolness . It was windless and dark . A cicala hidden in the heart of a pomegranate flower sang shrilly now and again . Now and again a carp leaped in the round pond . For the rest it was still , and never a leaf stirred . About the hour of the Ox , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> heard the sound of footsteps in the lane that lay beyond his garden hedge . Nearer and nearer they came . “ Women ’ s _geta_ , ” said the _samurai_ . He knew them by the hollow echoing noise . Looking over his rose hedge , he saw two slender women come out of the dimness hand in hand . One of them carried a lantern with a bunch of peony flowers tied to the handle . It was such a lantern as is used at the time of the _Bon_ in the service of the dead . It swung as the two women walked , casting an uncertain light . As they came abreast of the _samurai_ upon the other side of the hedge , they turned their faces to him . He knew them at once , and gave one great <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cry</span> . The girl with the peony lantern held it up so that the light fell upon him . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara Sama</span> , ” she <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> , “ by all that is most wonderful ! Why , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> , we were told that you were dead . We have daily recited the _Nembutsu_ for your soul these many moons ! ” “ Come in , come in , O ’ Yoné , ” he said ; “ and is it indeed your mistress that you hold by the hand ? Can it be my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> ? ... Oh , my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> ! ” O ’ Yoné answered , “ Who else should it be ? ” and the two came in at the garden gate . But the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Morning Dew</span> held up her sleeve to hide her face . “ How was it I lost you ? ” said the _samurai_ ; “ how was it I lost you , O ’ Yoné ? ” “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> , ” she said , “ we have moved to a little <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , a very little <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , in the quarter of the city which is called the Green Hill . We were suffered to take nothing with us there , and we are grown very poor . With grief and want my mistress is become pale. ” Then <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> took his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> ’ s sleeve to draw it gently from her face . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> , ” she sobbed , “ you will not <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> me , I am not fair. ” But when he looked upon her his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> flamed up within him like a consuming fire , and shook him from head to foot . He said never a word . She drooped . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> , ” she murmured , “ shall I go or stay ? ” And he said , “ Stay. ” A little before daybreak the _samurai_ fell into a deep sleep , and awoke to find himself alone in the clear light of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">morning</span> . He lost not an instant , but rose and went forth , and immediately made his way through Yedo to the quarter of the city which is called the Green Hill . Here he inquired for the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Morning Dew</span> , but no one could direct him . High and low he searched fruitlessly . It seemed to him that for the second time he had lost his dear <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> , and he turned homewards in bitter despair . His way led him through the grounds of a certain temple , and as he went he marked two graves that were side by side . One was little and obscure , but the other was marked by a fair monument , like the tomb of some great one . Before the monument there hung a lantern with a bunch of peony flowers tied to its handle . It was such a lantern as is used at the time of _Bon_ in the service of the dead . Long , long did the _samurai_ stand as one in a dream . Then he smiled a little and said : “ ‘ _We have moved to a little <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> ... a very little <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> ... upon the Green Hill ... we were suffered to take nothing with us there and we are grown very poor ... with grief and want my mistress is become pale .... _ ’ A little <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , a dark <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , yet you will make room for me , oh , my beloved , pale one of my desires . We have <span class=\"kw-tuned\">loved</span> for the space of ten existences , leave me not now ... my dear. ” Then he went home . His faithful servant met him and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">cried</span> : “ Now what ails you , master ? ” He said , “ Why , nothing at all .... I was never merrier. ” But the servant departed weeping , and saying , “ The mark of death is on his face ... and I , whither shall I go that bore him as a child in these arms ? ” Every night , for seven nights , the maidens with the peony lantern came to <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> ’ s dwelling . Fair weather or foul was the same to them . They came at the hour of the Ox . There was mystic wooing . By the strong bond of illusion the living and the dead were bound together . On the seventh night the servant of the _samurai_ , wakeful with fear and sorrow , made bold to peer into his <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> ’ s room through a crack in the wooden shutters . His hair stood on end and his blood ran cold to see <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> in the arms of a fearful thing , smiling up at the horror that was its face , stroking its dank green robe with languid fingers . With daylight the servant made his way to a <span class=\"kw-tuned\">holy man</span> of his acquaintance . When he had told his tale he asked , “ Is there any hope for <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara Sama</span> ? ” “ Alack , ” said the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">holy man</span> , “ who can withstand the power of Karma ? Nevertheless , there is a little hope. ” So he told the servant what he must do . Before nightfall , this one had set a sacred text above every door and window-place of his master ’ s <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> , and he had rolled in the silk of his master ’ s girdle a golden emblem of the Tathagata . When these things were done , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> being drawn two ways became himself as weak as water . And his servant took him in his arms , laid him upon his bed and covered him lightly , and saw him fall into a deep sleep . At the hour of the Ox there was heard the sound of footsteps in the lane , without the garden hedge . Nearer and nearer they came . They grew slow and stopped . “ What means this , O ’ Yoné , O ’ Yoné ? ” said a piteous voice . “ The <span class=\"kw-tuned\">house</span> is asleep , and I do not see my lord. ” “ Come home , sweet <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> ’ s heart is changed. ” “ That I will not , O ’ Yoné , O ’ Yoné ... you must find a way to bring me to my lord. ” “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lady</span> , we can not enter here . See the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Holy</span> Writing over every door and window-place ... we may not enter here. ” There was a sound of bitter weeping and a long wail . “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> , I have <span class=\"kw-tuned\">loved</span> thee through the space of ten existences. ” Then the footsteps retreated and their echo died away . The next night it was quite the same . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> slept in his weakness ; his servant watched ; the wraiths came and departed in sobbing despair . The third day , when <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> went to the bath , a thief stole the emblem , the golden emblem of the Tathagata , from his girdle . <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> did not mark it . But that night he lay awake . It was his servant that slept , worn out with watching . Presently a great rain fell and <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> , waking , heard the sound of it upon the roof . The heavens were opened and for hours the rain fell . And it tore the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">holy</span> text from over the round window in <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> ’ s chamber . At the hour of the Ox there was heard the sound of footsteps in the lane without the garden hedge . Nearer and nearer they came . They grew slow and stopped . “ This is the last time , O ’ Yoné , O ’ Yoné , therefore bring me to my <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> . Think of the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">love</span> of ten existences . Great is the power of Karma . There must be a way .... ” “ Come , my beloved , ” called <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> with a great voice . “ Open , <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lord</span> ... open and I come. ” But <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> could not move from his couch . “ Come , my beloved , ” he called for the second time . “ I can not come , though the separation wounds me like a sharp sword . Thus we suffer for the sins of a former life. ” So the <span class=\"kw-tuned\">lady</span> spoke and moaned like the lost soul that she was . But O ’ Yoné took her hand . “ See the round window , ” she said . Hand in hand the two rose lightly from the earth . Like vapour they passed through the unguarded window . The _samurai_ called , “ Come to me , beloved , ” for the third time . He was answered , “ <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Lord</span> , I come. ” In the grey <span class=\"kw-tuned\">morning</span> <span class=\"kw-tuned\">Hagiwara</span> ’ s servant found his master cold and dead . At his feet stood the peony lantern burning with a weird yellow flame . The servant shivered , took up the lantern and blew out the light ; for “ I can not bear it , ” he said . </div>\n",
