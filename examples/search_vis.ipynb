      "Aya said, “Come and see--come.”\n",
      "With that she drew them along the paths of the garden to the still pond,\n",
      "where were the dancing fireflies and the frogs that sang musically.\n",
      "Holding each other’s hands, the maidens looked down into the water, and\n",
      "one and all they beheld the moon’s sister, and they laughed softly\n",
      "together. While they played by the water’s brim, the Lady Aya’s foot\n",
      "slipped upon a smooth stone, and most assuredly she would have fallen\n",
      "into the pond. But all of a sudden a youth leapt forward out of the\n",
      "sweet secrecy of the night, and caught her in his arms. For a moment all\n",
      "the maidens beheld the glimmer of his garments. Then he was gone. Aya\n",
      "stood alone, trembling. Down gazed the moon, wide-eyed and sorrowful;\n",
      "and still more sorrowful and sweet, upwards gazed the moon’s pale\n",
      "sister. They saw a band of silent maidens who stood in a wilderness of\n",
      "blossoming peony flowers, that grew to the water’s edge. It was the Lady\n",
      "Aya who loved them and had them planted so.\n",
      "Now the lady turned without a word and moved along the paths of the\n",
      "garden very slowly, hanging her head. When she came to the garden\n",
      "gallery she left all her maidens save one, and went silently to her\n",
      "bower.\n",
      "There she was for a long space, saying nothing. She sat and traced the\n",
      "pattern on her robe with the point of her finger. And Sada, her maiden,\n",
      "was over against her.\n",
      "At length, “He was a great lord,” said Aya.\n",
      "“Truth, lady.”\n",
      "“He was young.”\n",
      "“He was passing well-favoured.”\n",
      "“Alas! he saved my life, and I had not time to thank him.”\n",
      "“The moon shone upon the jewelled mounting of his sword.”\n",
      "“And his robe that was broidered with peony flowers--my peony flowers.”\n",
      "“Lady, the hour grows very late.”\n",
      "“Well, then, untie my girdle.”\n",
      "“You look pale, lady.”\n",
      "“Small marvel, I am weary.”\n",
      "“Lady, what of the young Lord of Ako?”\n",
      "“What of him? Why, I have not seen him. Enough, let be--no more of him.\n",
      "Alas! I am drowsy, I know not what I say.”\n",
      "After this night the Lady Aya, that had been so fresh and fair and\n",
      "dancing gay as a wave of the sea, fell into a pale melancholy. By day\n",
      "she sighed, and by night she wept. She smiled no more as she beheld her\n",
      "rich wedding-garments, and she would not play any more with her maidens\n",
      "upon the garden gallery. She wandered like a shadow, or lay speechless\n",
      "in her bower. And all the wise men and all the wise women of that\n",
      "country-side were not able to heal her of her sickness.\n",
      "Then the maid Sada, weeping and hiding her face with her sleeve, went to\n",
      "the Lord of the House and told him of the moonlight adventure and the\n",
      "fair youth of the peony bed.\n",
      "“Ah me,” she said, “my sweet mistress pines and dies for the love of\n",
      "this beautiful young man.”\n",
      "“Child,” said the _daimyo_, “how you talk! My daughter’s garden is well\n",
      "guarded by walls and by men-at-arms. It is not possible that any\n",
      "stranger should enter it. What, then, is this tale of the moon and a\n",
      "_samurai_ in peony garments and all manner of other foolishness, and how\n",
      "will such a tale sound in the ears of the Lord of Ako?”\n",
      "But Sada wept and said, “My mistress will die.”\n",
      "“To fight in the field, to flatter at Court and to speak in Council, all\n",
      "these are easy,” said the _daimyo_, “but preserve me from the affairs of\n",
      "my women, for they are too hard for me.”\n",
      "With that he made a search of all the castle and the castle grounds, but\n",
      "not a trace did he find of any stranger in hiding.\n",
      "That night the Lady Aya called piteously for the cooler air, so they\n",
      "bore her out on to her garden gallery, where she lay in O Sada’s arms. A\n",
      "minstrel of the household took his _biwa_, and to soothe her he made\n",
      "this song:\n",
      "“Music of my lute--\n",
      "Is it born, does it die,\n",
      "Is it truth or a lie?\n",
      "Whence, whence and where,\n",
      "Enchanted air?\n",
      "Music of my lute\n",
      "Is mute.\n",
      "“Sweet scents in the night--\n",
      "Do they float, do they seem,\n",
      "Are they essence of dream,\n",
      "Or thus are they said\n",
      "The thoughts of the Dead?\n",
      "Sweet scents in the night\n",
      "Delight.”\n",
      "Now, while the minstrel sang and touched his instrument, a fair youth\n",
      "stood up from the rosy sea of peonies by the pond. All there saw him\n",
      "clearly, his bright eyes, his sword, and his dress broidered with\n",
      "flowers. The Lady Aya gave a wild cry and ran to the edge of the garden\n",
      "gallery, holding out her white arms. And immediately the vision passed\n",
      "away. But the minstrel took up his _biwa_ once more and sang:\n",
      "“Love more strange than death--\n",
      "Is it longer than life,\n",
      "Is it hotter than strife?\n",
      "Strong, strong and blind,\n",
      "Transcending kind--\n",
      "Love more strange than death\n",
      "Or breath.”\n",
      "At this the mysterious knight of the flowers stood once again straight\n",
      "and tall, and his shining eyes were fixed upon the Lady Aya.\n",
      "Then a gentleman of the company of the _daimyo_, who was a mighty man of\n",
      "war, drew his sword forthwith and leapt down amongst the peonies to do\n",
      "battle with the bold stranger that so gazed upon his master’s daughter.\n",
      "And at that a cloud drew across the moon’s face as if by faery, and of a\n",
      "sudden a great hot wind blew from the south. The lights died upon the\n",
      "garden gallery, the maidens held their garments together while their\n",
      "long gossamer sleeves floated out. All the peony bed was tossed about\n",
      "like a troubled sea, and the pink and white petals flew like foam. A\n",
      "mist, damp and over-sweet, hung upon the wind, so that all who were\n",
      "there grew faint and clung to one another, trembling.\n",
      "When they were recovered, they found the night still and the moon\n",
      "undimmed. The soldier of the _daimyo’s_ company stood panting and white\n",
      "as death at the steps of the garden gallery. In his right hand he held\n",
      "his unstained sword, in his left a perfect peony flower.\n",
      "“I have him,” he shouted; “he could not escape me. I have him fast.”\n",
      "Aya said, “Give me the flower”; and he gave it her without a word, as\n",
      "one in a dream.\n",
      "Then Aya went to her bower and slept with the peony upon her breast and\n",
      "was satisfied.\n",
      "For nine days she kept the flower. The sweet colour came to her face,\n",
      "and the light to her eyes. She was perfectly healed of her sickness.\n",
      "She set the peony in a bronze vase and it did not droop or fade, but\n",
      "grew larger and more lovely all the nine days.\n",
      "At the end of this time the young Lord of Ako came riding in great pomp\n",
      "and state to claim his long-promised lady. So he and the Lady Aya were\n",
      "wed in the midst of much feasting and rejoicing. Howbeit, they say she\n",
      "made but a pale bride. And the same day the peony withered and was\n",
      "thrown away.\n",

      "Tomodata, the young _samurai_, owed allegiance to the Lord of Noto. He\n",
      "was a soldier, a courtier, and a poet. He had a sweet voice and a\n",
      "beautiful face, a noble form and a very winning address. He was a\n",
      "graceful dancer, and excelled in every manly sport. He was wealthy and\n",
      "generous and kind. He was beloved by rich and by poor.\n",
      "Now his _daimyo_, the Lord of Noto, wanted a man to undertake a mission\n",
      "of trust. He chose Tomodata, and called him to his presence.\n",
      "“Are you loyal?” said the _daimyo_.\n",
      "“My lord, you know it,” answered Tomodata.\n",
      "“Do you love me, then?” asked the _daimyo_.\n",
      "“Ay, my good lord,” said Tomodata, kneeling before him.\n",
      "“Then carry my message,” said the _daimyo_. “Ride and do not spare your\n",
      "beast. Ride straight, and fear not the mountains nor the enemies’\n",
      "country. Stay not for storm nor any other thing. Lose your life; but\n",
      "betray not your trust. Above all, do not look any maid between the eyes.\n",
      "Ride, and bring me word again quickly.”\n",
      "Thus spoke the Lord of Noto.\n",
      "So Tomodata got him to horse, and away he rode upon his quest. Obedient\n",
      "to his lord’s commands, he spared not his good beast. He rode straight,\n",
      "and was not afraid of the steep mountain passes nor of the enemies’\n",
      "country. Ere he had been three days upon the road the autumn tempest\n",
      "burst, for it was the ninth month. Down poured the rain in a torrent.\n",
      "Tomodata bowed his head and rode on. The wind howled in the pine-tree\n",
      "branches. It blew a typhoon. The good horse trembled and could scarcely\n",
      "keep its feet, but Tomodata spoke to it and urged it on. His own cloak\n",
      "he drew close about him and held it so that it might not blow away, and\n",
      "in this wise he rode on.\n",
      "The fierce storm swept away many a familiar landmark of the road, and\n",
      "buffeted the _samurai_ so that he became weary almost to fainting.\n",
      "Noontide was as dark as twilight, twilight was as dark as night, and\n",
      "when night fell it was as black as the night of Yomi, where lost souls\n",
      "wander and cry. By this time Tomodata had lost his way in a wild, lonely\n",
      "place, where, as it seemed to him, no human soul inhabited. His horse\n",
      "could carry him no longer, and he wandered on foot through bogs and\n",
      "marshes, through rocky and thorny tracks, until he fell into deep\n",
      "despair.\n",
      "“Alack!” he cried, “must I die in this wilderness and the quest of the\n",
      "Lord of Noto be unfulfilled?”\n",
      "At this moment the great winds blew away the clouds of the sky, so that\n",
      "the moon shone very brightly forth, and by the sudden light Tomodata saw\n",
      "a little hill on his right hand. Upon the hill was a small thatched\n",
      "cottage, and before the cottage grew three green weeping-willow trees.\n",
      "“Now, indeed, the gods be thanked!” said Tomodata, and he climbed the\n",
      "hill in no time. Light shone from the chinks of the cottage door, and\n",
      "smoke curled out of a hole in the roof. The three willow trees swayed\n",
      "and flung out their green streamers in the wind. Tomodata threw his\n",
      "horse’s rein over a branch of one of them, and called for admittance to\n",
      "the longed-for shelter.\n",
      "At once the cottage door was opened by an old woman, very poorly but\n",
      "neatly clad.\n",
      "“Who rides abroad upon such a night?” she asked, “and what wills he\n",
      "here?”\n",
      "“I am a weary traveller, lost and benighted upon your lonely moor. My\n",
      "name is Tomodata. I am a _samurai_ in the service of the Lord of Noto,\n",
      "upon whose business I ride. Show me hospitality for the love of the\n",
      "gods. I crave food and shelter for myself and my horse.”\n",
      "As the young man stood speaking the water streamed from his garments. He\n",
      "reeled a little, and put out a hand to hold on by the side-post of the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "“Come in, come in, young sir!” cried the old woman, full of pity. “Come\n",
      "in to the warm fire. You are very welcome. We have but coarse fare to\n",
      "offer, but it shall be set before you with great good-will. As to your\n",
      "horse, I see you have delivered him to my daughter; he is in good\n",
      "hands.”\n",
      "At this Tomodata turned sharply round. Just behind him, in the dim\n",
      "light, stood a very young girl with the horse’s rein thrown over her\n",
      "arm. Her garments were blown about and her long loose hair streamed out\n",
      "upon the wind. The _samurai_ wondered how she had come there. Then the\n",
      "old woman drew him into the cottage and shut the door. Before the fire\n",
      "sat the good man of the house, and the two old people did the very best\n",
      "they could for Tomodata. They gave him dry garments, comforted him with\n",
      "hot rice wine, and quickly prepared a good supper for him.\n",
      "Presently the daughter of the house came in, and retired behind a screen\n",
      "to comb her hair and to dress afresh. Then she came forth to wait upon\n",
      "him. She wore a blue robe of homespun cotton. Her feet were bare. Her\n",
      "hair was not tied nor confined in any way, but lay along her smooth\n",
      "cheeks, and hung, straight and long and black, to her very knees. She\n",
      "was slender and graceful. Tomodata judged her to be about fifteen years\n",
      "old, and knew well that she was the fairest maiden he had ever seen.\n",
      "At length she knelt at his side to pour wine into his cup. She held the\n",
      "wine-bottle in two hands and bent her head. Tomodata turned to look at\n",
      "her. When she had made an end of pouring the wine and had set down the\n",
      "bottle, their glances met, and Tomodata looked at her full between the\n",
      "eyes, for he forgot altogether the warning of his _daimyo_, the Lord of\n",
      "Noto.\n",
      "“Maiden,” he said, “what is your name?”\n",
      "She answered: “They call me the Green Willow.”\n",
      "“The dearest name on earth,” he said, and again he looked her between\n",
      "the eyes. And because he looked so long her face grew rosy red, from\n",
      "chin to forehead, and though she smiled her eyes filled with tears.\n",
      "Ah me, for the Lord of Noto’s quest!\n",
      "Then Tomodata made this little song:\n",
      "“Long-haired maiden, do you know\n",
      "That with the red dawn I must go?\n",
      "Do you wish me far away?\n",
      "Cruel long-haired maiden, say--\n",
      "Long-haired maiden, if you know\n",
      "That with the red dawn I must go,\n",
      "Why, oh why, do you blush so?”\n",
      "And the maiden, the Green Willow, answered:\n",
      "“The dawn comes if I will or no;\n",
      "Never leave me, never go.\n",
      "My sleeve shall hide the blush away.\n",
      "The dawn comes if I will or no;\n",
      "Never leave me, never go.\n",
      "Lord, I lift my long sleeve so....”\n",
      "“Oh, Green Willow, Green Willow ...” sighed Tomodata.\n",
      "That night he lay before the fire--still, but with wide eyes, for no\n",
      "sleep came to him though he was weary. He was sick for love of the Green\n",
      "Willow. Yet by the rules of his service he was bound in honour to think\n",
      "of no such thing. Moreover, he had the quest of the Lord of Noto that\n",
      "lay heavy on his heart, and he longed to keep truth and loyalty.\n",
      "At the first peep of day he rose up. He looked upon the kind old man who\n",
      "had been his host, and left a purse of gold at his side as he slept. The\n",
      "maiden and her mother lay behind the screen.\n",
      "Tomodata saddled and bridled his horse, and mounting, rode slowly away\n",
      "through the mist of the early morning. The storm was quite over and it\n",
      "was as still as Paradise. The green grass and the leaves shone with the\n",
      "wet. The sky was clear, and the path very bright with autumn flowers;\n",
      "but Tomodata was sad.\n",
      "When the sunlight streamed across his saddlebow, “Ah, Green Willow,\n",
      "Green Willow,” he sighed; and at noontide it was “Green Willow, Green\n",
      "Willow”; and “Green Willow, Green Willow,” when the twilight fell. That\n",
      "night he lay in a deserted shrine, and the place was so holy that in\n",
      "spite of all he slept from midnight till the dawn. Then he rose, having\n",
      "it in his mind to wash himself in a cold stream that flowed near by, so\n",
      "as to go refreshed upon his journey; but he was stopped upon the\n",
      "shrine’s threshold. There lay the Green Willow, prone upon the ground. A\n",
      "slender thing she lay, face downwards, with her black hair flung about\n",
      "her. She lifted a hand and held Tomodata by the sleeve. “My lord, my\n",
      "lord,” she said, and fell to sobbing piteously.\n",
      "He took her in his arms without a word, and soon he set her on his horse\n",
      "before him, and together they rode the livelong day. It was little they\n",
      "recked of the road they went, for all the while they looked into each\n",
      "other’s eyes. The heat and the cold were nothing to them. They felt not\n",
      "the sun nor the rain; of truth or falsehood they thought nothing at all;\n",
      "nor of filial piety, nor of the Lord of Noto’s quest, nor of honour nor\n",
      "plighted word. They knew but the one thing. Alas, for the ways of love!\n",
      "At last they came to an unknown city, where they stayed. Tomodata\n",
      "carried gold and jewels in his girdle, so they found a house built of\n",
      "white wood, spread with sweet white mats. In every dim room there could\n",
      "be heard the sound of the garden waterfall, whilst the swallow flitted\n",
      "across and across the paper lattice. Here they dwelt, knowing but the\n",
      "one thing. Here they dwelt three years of happy days, and for Tomodata\n",
      "and the Green Willow the years were like garlands of sweet flowers.\n",
      "In the autumn of the third year it chanced that the two of them went\n",
      "forth into the garden at dusk, for they had a wish to see the round moon\n",
      "rise; and as they watched, the Green Willow began to shake and shiver.\n",
      "“My dear,” said Tomodata, “you shake and shiver; and it is no wonder,\n",
      "the night wind is chill. Come in.” And he put his arm around her.\n",
      "At this she gave a long and pitiful cry, very loud and full of agony,\n",
      "and when she had uttered the cry she failed, and dropped her head upon\n",
      "her love’s breast.\n",
      "“Tomodata,” she whispered, “say a prayer for me; I die.”\n",
      "“Oh, say not so, my sweet, my sweet! You are but weary; you are faint.”\n",
      "He carried her to the stream’s side, where the iris grew like swords,\n",
      "and the lotus-leaves like shields, and laved her forehead with water. He\n",
      "said: “What is it, my dear? Look up and live.”\n",
      "“The tree,” she moaned, “the tree ... they have cut down my tree.\n",
      "Remember the Green Willow.”\n",
      "With that she slipped, as it seemed, from his arms to his feet; and he,\n",
      "casting himself upon the ground, found only silken garments, bright\n",
      "coloured, warm and sweet, and straw sandals, scarlet-thonged.\n",
      "In after years, when Tomodata was a holy man, he travelled from shrine\n",
      "to shrine, painfully upon his feet, and acquired much merit.\n",
      "Once, at nightfall, he found himself upon a lonely moor. On his right\n",
      "hand he beheld a little hill, and on it the sad ruins of a poor thatched\n",
      "cottage. The door swung to and fro with broken latch and creaking hinge.\n",
      "Before it stood three old stumps of willow trees that had long since\n",
      "been cut down. Tomodata stood for a long time still and silent. Then he\n",
      "sang gently to himself:\n",
      "“Long-haired maiden, do you know\n",
      "That with the red dawn I must go?\n",
      "Do you wish me far away?\n",
      "Cruel long-haired maiden, say--\n",
      "Long-haired maiden, if you know\n",
      "That with the red dawn I must go,\n",
      "Why, oh why, do you blush so?”\n",
      "“Ah, foolish song! The gods forgive me.... I should have recited the\n",

      "The elder brother was a hunter. He loved the deep woods and the chase.\n",
      "He went from dawn to dark with his bow and his arrows. Swiftly he could\n",
      "run; he was strong and bright-eyed. The younger brother was a dreamer;\n",
      "his eyes were gentle. From dawn to dark he would sit with his book or\n",
      "with his thoughts. Sweetly could he sing of love, or of war, or of the\n",

      "gods.\n",
      "Upon a fair day of summer the hunter betook himself very early to the\n",

      "“It is the fairies’ money,” he said; “it will buy all the joys of\n",

      "there led to the shrine a hundred steps, moss-grown and grey. Beside\n",

      "In the shrine there was a hush of noonday. The smoke of incense curled\n",
      "and hung upon the air. Dimly shone the gold and the bronze, the lights\n",
      "and the mystic mirrors.\n",
      "There was a sound of singing in the shrine, and turning, the dreamer saw\n",
      "a man who stood at his right hand. The man was taller than any child of\n",
      "earth. Moreover, his face shone with the glory of a youth that cannot\n",
      "pass away. He held a year-old child upon his arm and hushed it to sleep,\n",
      "singing a strange melody. When the babe fell asleep he was well pleased,\n",
      "and smiled.\n",
      "“What babe is that?” said the dreamer.\n",
      "“O dreamer, it is no babe, but a spirit.”\n",
      "“Then, my lord, what are you?” said the dreamer.\n",
      "“I am Jizo, who guards the souls of little children. It is most pitiful\n",
      "to hear their crying when they come to the sandy river-bed, the\n",
      "_Sai-no-kawara_. O dreamer, they come alone, as needs they must, wailing\n",
      "and wandering, stretching out their pretty hands. They have a task,\n",
      "which is to pile stones for a tower of prayer. But in the night come the\n",
      "_Oni_ to throw down the towers and to scatter all the stones. So the\n",
      "children are made afraid, and their labour is lost.”\n",
      "“What then, my lord Jizo?” said the dreamer.\n",
      "“Why, then I come, for the Great One gives me leave. And I call ‘Come\n",
      "hither, wandering souls.’ And they fly to me that I may hide them in my\n",
      "long sleeves. I carry them in my arms and on my breast, where they lie\n",
      "light and cold,--as light and cold as the morning mist upon the\n",
      "mountains.”\n",
      "When he had spoken, the year-old child stirred and murmured: so he\n",
      "rocked it, and wandered to and fro in the quiet temple court and hushed\n",
      "it as he went.\n",
      "So the swift moments flew and the noontide passed away.\n",
      "Presently there came to the shrine a lady most gentle and beautiful.\n",
      "Grey was her robe, and she had silver sandals on her feet. She said, “I\n",
      "am called The Merciful. For mankind’s dear sake, I have refused eternal\n",
      "peace. The Great One has given to me a thousand loving arms, arms of\n",
      "mercy. And my hands are full of gifts. O dreamer, when you dream your\n",
      "dreams you shall see me in my lotus boat when I sail upon the mystic\n",
      "mere.”\n",
      "“Lady, Lady Kwannon ...” said the dreamer.\n",
      "Then came one clothed in blue, speaking with a sweet, deep, well-known\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "“I am Benten, the Goddess of the Sea and the Goddess of Song. My dragons\n",
      "are about me and beneath my feet. See their green scales and their opal\n",
      "eyes. Greeting, O dreamer!”\n",
      "After her there came a band of blooming boys, laughing and holding out\n",
      "their rosy arms. “We are the Sons of the Sea Goddess,” they said. “Come,\n",
      "dreamer, come to our cool caves.”\n",
      "The God of Roads came, and his three messengers with him. Three apes\n",
      "were the three messengers. The first ape covered his eyes with his\n",
      "hands, for he could see no evil thing. The second ape covered his ears\n",
      "with his hands, for he could hear no evil thing. The third ape covered\n",
      "his mouth with his hands, for he could speak no evil thing. Then came\n",
      "She, the fearful woman who takes the clothes of the dead who are not\n",
      "able to pay their toll, so that they must stand shivering at the\n",
      "entrance of the mysterious Three Ways. They are unfortunate indeed.\n",
      "And many and many a vision the dreamer saw in that enchanted shrine.\n",
      "And dark night fell, with storm and tempest and the sound of rain upon\n",
      "the roof. Yet the dreamer never stirred. Suddenly there was a sound of\n",
      "hurrying feet without. A voice called loud, “My brother, my brother, my\n",
      "brother!...” In sprang the hunter through the golden temple doors.\n",
      "“Where are you?” he cried, “my brother, my brother!” He had his swinging\n",
      "lantern in his hand and held it high, as he flung his long blown hair\n",
      "back over his shoulder. His face was bright with the rain upon it, his\n",
      "eyes were as keen as an eagle’s.\n",
      "“O brother ...” said the dreamer, and ran to meet him.\n",
      "“Now the dear gods be thanked that I have you safe and sound,” said the\n",
      "hunter. “Half the night I have sought you, wandering in the forest and\n",
      "by the stream’s side. I was all to blame for leaving you ... my little\n",
      "brother.” With that, he took his brother’s face between his two warm\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "But the dreamer sighed, “I have been with the gods all night,” he said,\n",
      "“and I think I see them still. The place is holy.”\n",
      "Then the hunter flashed his light upon the temple walls, upon the\n",
      "gilding and the bronze.\n",
      "“I see no gods,” he said.\n",
      "“What see you, brother?”\n",
      "“I see a row of stones, broken images, grey, with moss-grown feet.”\n",
      "“They are grey because they are sad, they are sad because they are\n",
      "forgotten,” said the dreamer.\n",
      "But the hunter took him by the hand and led him into the night.\n",
      "The dreamer said, “O brother, how sweet is the scent of the bean fields\n",
      "after the rain.”\n",
      "“Now bind your sandals on,” said the hunter, “and I’ll run you a race to\n",

      "Jofuku was the Wise Man of China. Many books he read, and he never\n",
      "forgot what was in them. All the characters he knew as he knew the lines\n",
      "in the palm of his hand. He learned secrets from birds and beasts, and\n",
      "herbs and flowers and trees, and rocks and metals. He knew magic and\n",
      "poetry and philosophy. He grew full of years and wisdom. All the people\n",
      "honoured him; but he was not happy, for he had a word written upon his\n",
      "heart.\n",
      "The word was _Mutability_. It was with him day and night, and sorely it\n",
      "troubled him. Moreover, in the days of Jofuku a tyrant ruled over China,\n",
      "and he made the Wise Man’s life a burden.\n",
      "“Jofuku,” he said, “teach the nightingales of my wood to sing me the\n",
      "songs of the Chinese poets.”\n",
      "Jofuku could not do it for all his wisdom.\n",
      "“Alas, liege,” he said, “ask me another thing and I will give it you,\n",
      "though it cost me the blood of my heart.”\n",
      "“Have a care,” said the Emperor, “look to your ways. Wise men are cheap\n",
      "in China; am I one to be dishonoured?”\n",
      "“Ask me another thing,” said the Wise Man.\n",
      "“Well, then, scent me the peony with the scent of the jessamine. The\n",
      "peony is brilliant, imperial; the jessamine is small, pale, foolish.\n",
      "Nevertheless, its perfume is sweet. Scent me the peony with the scent of\n",
      "the jessamine.”\n",
      "But Jofuku stood silent and downcast.\n",
      "“By the gods,” cried the Emperor, “this wise man is a fool! Here, some\n",
      "of you, off with his head.”\n",
      "“Liege,” said the Wise Man, “spare me my life and I will set sail for\n",
      "Horaizan where grows the herb Immortality. I will pluck this herb and\n",
      "bring it back to you again, that you may live and reign for ever.”\n",
      "The Emperor considered.\n",
      "“Well, go,” he said, “and linger not, or it will be the worse for you.”\n",
      "Jofuku went and found brave companions to go with him on the great\n",
      "adventure, and he manned a junk with the most famous mariners of China,\n",
      "and he took stores on board, and gold; and when he had made all things\n",
      "ready he set sail in the seventh month, about the time of the full moon.\n",
      "The Emperor himself came down to the seashore.\n",
      "“Speed, speed, Wise Man,” he said; “fetch me the herb Immortality, and\n",
      "see that you do it presently. If you return without it, you and your\n",
      "companions shall die the death.”\n",
      "“Farewell, liege,” called Jofuku from the junk. So they went with a fair\n",
      "wind for their white sails. The boards creaked, the ropes quivered, the\n",
      "water splashed against the junk’s side, the sailors sang as they steered\n",
      "a course eastward, the brave companions were merry. But the Wise Man of\n",
      "China looked forward and looked back, and was sad because of the word\n",
      "written upon his heart--_Mutability_.\n",
      "The junk of Jofuku was for many days upon the wild sea, steering a\n",
      "course eastwards. He and the sailors and the brave companions suffered\n",
      "many things. The great heat burnt them, and the great cold froze them.\n",
      "Hungry and thirsty they were, and some of them fell sick and died. More\n",
      "were slain in a fight with pirates. Then came the dread typhoon, and\n",
      "mountain waves that swept the junk. The masts and the sails were washed\n",
      "away with the rich stores, and the gold was lost for ever. Drowned were\n",
      "the famous mariners, and the brave companions every one. Jofuku was left\n",
      "alone.\n",
      "In the grey dawn he looked up. Far to the east he saw a mountain, very\n",
      "faint, the colour of pearl, and on the mountain top there grew a tree,\n",
      "tall, with spreading branches. The Wise Man murmured:\n",
      "“The Island of Horaizan is east of the east, and there is Fusan, the\n",
      "Wonder Mountain. On the heights of Fusan there grows a tree whose\n",
      "branches hide the Mysteries of Life.”\n",
      "Jofuku lay weak and weary and could not lift a finger. Nevertheless,\n",
      "the junk glided nearer and nearer to the shore. Still and blue grew the\n",
      "waters of the sea, and Jofuku saw the bright green grass and the\n",
      "many-coloured flowers of the island. Soon there came troops of young men\n",
      "and maidens bearing garlands and singing songs of welcome; and they\n",
      "waded out into the water and drew the junk to land. Jofuku was aware of\n",
      "the sweet and spicy odours that clung to their garments and their hair.\n",
      "At their invitation he left the junk, which drifted away and was no more\n",
      "seen.\n",
      "He said, “I have come to Horaizan the Blest.” Looking up he saw that the\n",
      "trees were full of birds with blue and golden feathers. The birds filled\n",
      "the air with delightful melody. On all sides there hung the orange and\n",
      "the citron, the persimmon and the pomegranate, the peach and the plum\n",
      "and the loquat. The ground at his feet was as a rich brocade,\n",
      "embroidered with every flower that is. The happy dwellers in Horaizan\n",
      "took him by the hands and spoke lovingly to him.\n",
      "“How strange it is,” said Jofuku, “I do not feel my old age any more.”\n",
      "“What is old age?” they said.\n",
      "“Neither do I feel any pain.”\n",
      "“Now what is pain?” they said.\n",
      "“The word is no longer written on my heart.”\n",
      "“What word do you speak of, beloved?”\n",
      "“_Mutability_ is the word.”\n",
      "“And what may be its interpretation?”\n",
      "“Tell me,” said the Wise Man, “is this death?”\n",

      "The Wise Man of Japan was Wasobiobe. He was full as wise as the Wise Man\n",
      "of China. He was not old but young. The people honoured him and loved\n",
      "him. Often he was happy enough.\n",
      "It was his pleasure to venture alone in a frail boat out to sea, there\n",
      "to meditate in the wild and watery waste. Once as he did this it chanced\n",
      "that he fell asleep in his boat, and he slept all night long, while his\n",
      "boat drifted out to the eastward. So, when he awoke in the bright light\n",
      "of morning, he found himself beneath the shadow of Fusan, the Wonder\n",
      "Mountain. His boat lay in the waters of a river of Horaizan, and he\n",
      "steered her amongst the flowering iris and the lotus, and sprang on\n",

      "“The sweetest spot in the world!” he said. “I think I have come to\n",

      "When they had given him to eat of the delicious fruit of the island,\n",
      "they laid them down upon a bank of flowers to hear sweet music.\n",
      "Afterwards they wandered in the woods and groves. They rode and hunted,\n",
      "or bathed in the warm sea-water. They feasted and enjoyed every\n",
      "delightful pleasure. So the long day lingered, and there was no night,\n",

      "“I cannot find my boat.”\n",
      "“What matter, brother?” said Jofuku. “You want no boat here.”\n",
      "“Indeed, my brother, I do. I want my boat to take me home. I am sick for\n",
      "home. There’s the truth.”\n",
      "“Are you not happy in Horaizan?”\n",
      "“No, for I have a word written upon my heart. The word is _Humanity_.\n",
      "Because of it I am troubled and have no peace.”\n",
      "“Strange,” said the Wise Man of China. “Once I too had a word written on\n",
      "my heart. The word was _Mutability_, but I have forgotten what it means.\n",
      "Do you too forget.”\n",
      "“Nay, I can never forget,” said the Wise Man of Japan.\n",
      "He sought out the Crane, who is a great traveller, and besought her,\n",
      "“Take me home to my own land.”\n",
      "“Alas,” the Crane said, “if I did so you would die. This is the Island\n",
      "of Eternal Youth; do you know you have been here for a hundred years? If\n",
      "you go away you will feel old age and weariness and pain, then you will\n",
      "die.”\n",
      "“No matter,” said Wasobiobe, “take me home.”\n",
      "Then the Crane took him on her strong back and flew with him. Day and\n",
      "night she flew and never tarried and never tired. At last she said, “Do\n",
      "you see the shore?”\n",
      "And he said, “I see it. Praise be to the gods.”\n",
      "She said, “Where shall I carry you?... You have but a little time to\n",
      "live.”\n",
      "“Good Crane, upon the dear sand of my country, under the spreading pine,\n",
      "there sits a poor fisherman mending his net. Take me to him that I may\n",
      "die in his arms.”\n",
      "So the Crane laid Wasobiobe at the poor fisherman’s feet. And the\n",
      "fisherman raised him in his arms. And Wasobiobe laid his head against\n",
      "the fisherman’s humble breast.\n",
      "“I might have lived for ever,” he said, “but for the word that is\n",
      "written on my heart.”\n",
      "“What word?” said the fisherman.\n",
      "“_Humanity_ is the word,” the Wise Man murmured. “I am grown old--hold\n",
      "me closer. Ah, the pain....” He gave a great cry.\n",
      "Afterwards he smiled. Then his breath left him with a sigh, and he was\n",
      "dead.\n",

      "[Illustration: Reflections.--_P. 78._]\n",
      "Long enough ago there dwelt within a day’s journey of the city of Kioto\n",
      "a gentleman of simple mind and manners, but good estate. His wife, rest\n",
      "her soul, had been dead these many years, and the good man lived in\n",
      "great peace and quiet with his only son. They kept clear of women-kind,\n",
      "and knew nothing at all either of their winning or their bothering ways.\n",
      "They had good steady men-servants in their house, and never set eyes on\n",
      "a pair of long sleeves or a scarlet _obi_ from morning till night.\n",
      "The truth is that they were as happy as the day is long. Sometimes they\n",
      "laboured in the rice-fields. Other days they went a-fishing. In the\n",
      "spring, forth they went to admire the cherry flower or the plum, and\n",
      "later they set out to view the iris or the peony or the lotus, as the\n",
      "case might be. At these times they would drink a little _saké_, and\n",
      "twist their blue and white _tenegui_ about their heads and be as jolly\n",
      "as you please, for there was no one to say them nay. Often enough they\n",
      "came home by lantern light. They wore their oldest clothes, and were\n",
      "mighty irregular at their meals.\n",
      "But the pleasures of life are fleeting--more’s the pity!--and presently\n",
      "the father felt old age creeping upon him.\n",
      "One night, as he sat smoking and warming his hands over the charcoal,\n",
      "“Boy,” says he, “it’s high time you got married.”\n",
      "“Now the gods forbid!” cries the young man. “Father, what makes you say\n",
      "such terrible things? Or are you joking? You must be joking,” he says.\n",
      "“I’m not joking at all,” says the father; “I never spoke a truer word,\n",
      "and that you’ll know soon enough.”\n",
      "“But, father, I am mortally afraid of women.”\n",
      "“And am I not the same?” says the father. “I’m sorry for you, my boy.”\n",
      "“Then what for must I marry?” says the son.\n",
      "“In the way of nature I shall die before long, and you’ll need a wife to\n",
      "take care of you.”\n",
      "Now the tears stood in the young man’s eyes when he heard this, for he\n",
      "was tender-hearted; but all he said was, “I can take care of myself very\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "“That’s the very thing you cannot,” says his father.\n",
      "The long and short of it was that they found the young man a wife. She\n",
      "was young, and as pretty as a picture. Her name was Tassel, just that,\n",
      "or Fusa, as they say in her language.\n",
      "After they had drunk down the “Three Times Three” together and so\n",
      "became man and wife, they stood alone, the young man looking hard at the\n",
      "girl. For the life of him he did not know what to say to her. He took a\n",
      "bit of her sleeve and stroked it with his hand. Still he said nothing\n",
      "and looked mighty foolish. The girl turned red, turned pale, turned red\n",
      "again, and burst into tears.\n",
      "“Honourable Tassel, don’t do that, for the dear gods’ sake,” says the\n",
      "young man.\n",
      "“I suppose you don’t like me,” sobs the girl. “I suppose you don’t think\n",
      "I’m pretty.”\n",
      "“My dear,” he says, “you’re prettier than the bean-flower in the field;\n",
      "you’re prettier than the little bantam hen in the farm-yard; you’re\n",
      "prettier than the rose carp in the pond. I hope you’ll be happy with my\n",
      "father and me.”\n",
      "At this she laughed a little and dried her eyes. “Get on another pair of\n",
      "_hakama_,” she says, “and give me those you’ve got on you; there’s a\n",
      "great hole in them--I was noticing it all the time of the wedding!”\n",
      "Well, this was not a bad beginning, and taking one thing with another\n",
      "they got on pretty well, though of course things were not as they had\n",
      "been in that blessed time when the young man and his father did not set\n",
      "eyes upon a pair of long sleeves or an _obi_ from morning till night.\n",
      "By and by, in the way of nature, the old man died. It is said he made a\n",
      "very good end, and left that in his strong-box which made his son the\n",
      "richest man in the country-side. But this was no comfort at all to the\n",
      "poor young man, who mourned his father with all his heart. Day and night\n",
      "he paid reverence to the tomb. Little sleep or rest he got, and little\n",
      "heed he gave to his wife, Mistress Tassel, and her whimsies, or even to\n",
      "the delicate dishes she set before him. He grew thin and pale, and she,\n",
      "poor maid, was at her wits’ end to know what to do with him. At last she\n",
      "said, “My dear, and how would it be if you were to go to Kioto for a\n",
      "little?”\n",
      "“And what for should I do that?” he says.\n",
      "It was on the tip of her tongue to answer, “To enjoy yourself,” but she\n",
      "saw it would never do to say that.\n",
      "“Oh,” she says, “as a kind of a duty. They say every man that loves his\n",
      "country should see Kioto; and besides, you might give an eye to the\n",
      "fashions, so as to tell me what like they are when you get home. My\n",
      "things,” she says, “are sadly behind the times! I’d like well enough to\n",
      "know what people are wearing!”\n",
      "“I’ve no heart to go to Kioto,” says the young man, “and if I had, it’s\n",
      "the planting-out time of the rice, and the thing’s not to be done, so\n",
      "there’s an end of it.”\n",
      "All the same, after two days he bids his wife get out his best _hakama_\n",
      "and _haouri_, and to make up his _bento_ for a journey. “I’m thinking of\n",
      "going to Kioto,” he tells her.\n",
      "“Well, I am surprised,” says Mistress Tassel. “And what put such an idea\n",
      "into your head, if I may ask?”\n",
      "“I’ve been thinking it’s a kind of duty,” says the young man.\n",
      "“Oh, indeed,” says Mistress Tassel to this, and nothing more, for she\n",
      "had some grains of sense. And the next morning as ever was she packs her\n",
      "husband off bright and early for Kioto, and betakes herself to some\n",
      "little matter of house cleaning she has on hand.\n",
      "The young man stepped out along the road, feeling a little better in his\n",
      "spirits, and before long he reached Kioto. It is likely he saw many\n",
      "things to wonder at. Amongst temples and palaces he went. He saw castles\n",
      "and gardens, and marched up and down fine streets of shops, gazing about\n",
      "him with his eyes wide open, and his mouth too, very like, for he was a\n",
      "simple soul.\n",
      "At length, one fine day he came upon a shop full of metal mirrors that\n",
      "glittered in the sunshine.\n",
      "“Oh, the pretty silver moons!” says the simple soul to himself. And he\n",
      "dared to come near and take up a mirror in his hand.\n",
      "The next minute he turned as white as rice and sat him down on the seat\n",
      "in the shop door, still holding the mirror in his hand and looking into\n",
      "it.\n",
      "“Why, father,” he said, “how did you come here? You are not dead, then?\n",
      "Now the dear gods be praised for that! Yet I could have sworn---- But no\n",
      "matter, since you are here alive and well. You are something pale still,\n",
      "but how young you look. You move your lips, father, and seem to speak,\n",
      "but I do not hear you. You’ll come home with me, dear, and live with us\n",
      "just as you used to do? You smile, you smile, that is well.”\n",
      "“Fine mirrors, my young gentleman,” said the shopman, “the best that can\n",
      "be made, and that’s one of the best of the lot you have there. I see you\n",
      "are a judge.”\n",
      "The young man clutched his mirror tight and sat staring stupidly enough\n",
      "no doubt. He trembled. “How much?” he whispered. “Is it for sale?” He\n",
      "was in a taking lest his father should be snatched from him.\n",
      "“For sale it is, indeed, most noble sir,” said the shopman, “and the\n",
      "price is a trifle, only two _bu_. It’s almost giving it away I am, as\n",
      "you’ll understand.”\n",
      "“Two _bu_--only two _bu_! Now the gods be praised for this their mercy!”\n",
      "cried the happy young man. He smiled from ear to ear, and he had the\n",
      "purse out of his girdle, and the money out of his purse, in a twinkling.\n",
      "Now it was the shopman who wished he had asked three _bu_ or even five.\n",
      "All the same he put a good face upon it, and packed the mirror in a fine\n",
      "white box and tied it up with green cords.\n",
      "“Father,” said the young man, when he had got away with it, “before we\n",
      "set out for home we must buy some gauds for the young woman there, my\n",
      "wife, you know.”\n",
      "Now, for the life of him, he could not have told why, but when he came\n",
      "to his home the young man never said a word to Mistress Tassel about\n",
      "buying his old father for two _bu_ in the Kioto shop. That was where he\n",
      "made his mistake, as things turned out.\n",
      "She was as pleased as you like with her coral hair-pins, and her fine\n",
      "new _obi_ from Kioto. “And I’m glad to see him so well and so happy,”\n",
      "she said to herself; “but I must say he’s been mighty quick to get over\n",
      "his sorrow after all. But men are just like children.” As for her\n",
      "husband, unbeknown to her he took a bit of green silk from her\n",
      "treasure-box and spread it in the cupboard of the _toko no ma_. There he\n",
      "placed the mirror in its box of white wood.\n",
      "Every morning early and every evening late, he went to the cupboard of\n",
      "the _toko no ma_ and spoke with his father. Many a jolly talk they had\n",
      "and many a hearty laugh together, and the son was the happiest young man\n",
      "of all that country-side, for he was a simple soul.\n",
      "But Mistress Tassel had a quick eye and a sharp ear, and it was not long\n",
      "before she marked her husband’s new ways.\n",
      "“What for does he go so often to the _toko no ma_,” she asked herself,\n",
      "“and what has he got there? I should be glad enough to know.” Not being\n",
      "one to suffer much in silence, she very soon asked her husband these\n",
      "same things.\n",
      "He told her the truth, the good young man. “And now I have my dear old\n",
      "father home again, I’m as happy as the day is long,” he says.\n",
      "“H’m,” she says.\n",
      "“And wasn’t two _bu_ cheap,” he says, “and wasn’t it a strange thing\n",
      "altogether?”\n",
      "“Cheap, indeed,” says she, “and passing strange; and why, if I may ask,”\n",
      "she says, “did you say nought of all this at the first?”\n",
      "The young man grew red.\n",
      "“Indeed, then, I cannot tell you, my dear,” he says. “I’m sorry, but I\n",
      "don’t know,” and with that he went out to his work.\n",
      "Up jumped Mistress Tassel the minute his back was turned, and to the\n",
      "_toko no ma_ she flew on the wings of the wind and flung open the doors\n",
      "with a clang.\n",
      "“My green silk for sleeve-linings!” she cried at once; “but I don’t see\n",
      "any old father here, only a white wooden box. What can he keep in it?”\n",
      "She opened the box quickly enough.\n",
      "“What an odd flat shining thing!” she said, and, taking up the mirror,\n",
      "looked into it.\n",
      "For a moment she said nothing at all, but the great tears of anger and\n",
      "jealousy stood in her pretty eyes, and her face flushed from forehead to\n",
      "chin.\n",
      "“A woman!” she cried, “a woman! So that is his secret! He keeps a woman\n",
      "in this cupboard. A woman, very young and very pretty--no, not pretty at\n",
      "all, but she thinks herself so. A dancing-girl from Kioto, I’ll be\n",
      "bound; ill-tempered too--her face is scarlet; and oh, how she frowns,\n",
      "nasty little spitfire. Ah, who could have thought it of him? Ah, it’s a\n",
      "miserable girl I am--and I’ve cooked his _daikon_ and mended his\n",
      "_hakama_ a hundred times. Oh! oh! oh!”\n",
      "With that, she threw the mirror into its case, and slammed-to the\n",
      "cupboard door upon it. Herself she flung upon the mats, and cried and\n",
      "sobbed as if her heart would break.\n",
      "In comes her husband.\n",
      "“I’ve broken the thong of my sandal,” says he, “and I’ve come to---- But\n",
      "what in the world?” and in an instant he was down on his knees beside\n",
      "Mistress Tassel doing what he could to comfort her, and to get her face\n",
      "up from the floor where she kept it.\n",
      "“Why, what is it, my own darling?” says he.\n",
      "“_Your_ own darling!” she answers very fierce through her sobs; and “I\n",
      "want to go home,” she cries.\n",
      "“But, my sweet, you are at home, and with your own husband.”\n",
      "“Pretty husband!” she says, “and pretty goings-on, with a woman in the\n",
      "cupboard! A hateful, ugly woman that thinks herself beautiful; and she\n",
      "has _my_ green sleeve-linings there with her to boot.”\n",
      "“Now, what’s all this about women and sleeve-linings? Sure you wouldn’t\n",
      "grudge poor old father that little green rag for his bed? Come, my dear,\n",
      "I’ll buy you twenty sleeve-linings.”\n",
      "At that she jumped to her feet and fairly danced with rage.\n",
      "“Old father! old father! old father!” she screamed; “am I a fool or a\n",
      "child? I saw the woman with my own eyes.”\n",
      "The poor young man didn’t know whether he was on his head or his heels.\n",
      "“Is it possible that my father is gone?” he said, and he took the mirror\n",
      "from the _toko no ma_.\n",
      "“That’s well; still the same old father that I bought for two _bu_. You\n",
      "seem worried, father; nay, then, smile as I do. There, that’s well.”\n",
      "Mistress Tassel came like a little fury and snatched the mirror from his\n",
      "hand. She gave but one look into it and hurled it to the other end of\n",
      "the room. It made such a clang against the woodwork, that servants and\n",
      "neighbours came rushing in to see what was the matter.\n",
      "“It is my father,” said the young man. “I bought him in Kioto for two\n",
      "_bu_.”\n",
      "“He keeps a woman in the cupboard who has stolen my green\n",
      "sleeve-linings,” sobbed the wife.\n",
      "After this there was a great to-do. Some of the neighbours took the\n",
      "man’s part and some the woman’s, with such a clatter and chatter and\n",
      "noise as never was; but settle the thing they could not, and none of\n",
      "them would look into the mirror, because they said it was bewitched.\n",
      "They might have gone on the way they were till doomsday, but that one of\n",
      "them said, “Let us ask the Lady Abbess, for she is a wise woman.” And\n",
      "off they all went to do what they might have done sooner.\n",
      "The Lady Abbess was a pious woman, the head of a convent of holy nuns.\n",
      "She was the great one at prayers and meditations and at mortifyings of\n",
      "the flesh, and she was the clever one, none the less, at human affairs.\n",
      "They took her the mirror, and she held it in her hands and looked into\n",
      "it for a long time. At last she spoke:\n",
      "“This poor woman,” she said, touching the mirror, “for it’s as plain as\n",
      "daylight that it is a woman--this poor woman was so troubled in her mind\n",
      "at the disturbance that she caused in a quiet house, that she has taken\n",
      "vows, shaved her head, and become a holy nun. Thus she is in her right\n",
      "place here. I will keep her, and instruct her in prayers and\n",
      "meditations. Go you home, my children; forgive and forget, be friends.”\n",
      "Then all the people said, “The Lady Abbess is the wise woman.”\n",
      "And she kept the mirror in her treasure.\n",
      "Mistress Tassel and her husband went home hand in hand.\n",
      "“So I was right, you see, after all,” she said.\n",
      "“Yes, yes, my dear,” said the simple young man, “of course. But I was\n",
      "wondering how my old father would get on at the holy convent. He was\n",
      "never much of a one for religion.”\n",
      "XI\n",
      "THE STORY OF SUSA, THE IMPETUOUS\n",
      "When Izanagi, the Lord who Invites, turned his back upon the unclean\n",
      "place, and bade farewell to Yomi, the World of the Dead, whither he had\n",
      "journeyed upon a quest, he beheld once more the Land of Fresh Rice Ears,\n",
      "and was glad. And he rested by the side of a clear river that he might\n",
      "perform purification.\n",
      "And Izanagi-no-Mikoto bathed in the upper reach. But he said, “The water\n",
      "of the upper reach is too rapid.” Then he bathed in the lower reach; but\n",
      "he said, “The water of the lower reach is too sluggish.” So he went down\n",
      "for the third time and bathed in the middle reach of the river. And as\n",
      "the water dropped from his beautiful countenance there were created\n",
      "three sublime deities--Ama Terassu, the Glory of High Heaven;\n",
      "Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami, the Moon-Night-Possessor; and Susa, the Impetuous,\n",
      "the Lord of the Sea.\n",
      "Then Izanagi-no-Mikoto rejoiced, saying, “Behold the three august\n",
      "children that are mine, who shall also be illustrious for ever.” And,\n",
      "taking the great string of jewels from his neck, he bestowed it upon\n",
      "Ama Terassu, the Glorious, and said to her, “Do Thine Augustness rule\n",
      "the Plain of High Heaven, shining in thy beauty by day.” So she took the\n",
      "august jewels and hid them in the storehouse of the gods.\n",
      "And the Lord of Invitation commanded Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami, saying, “Do\n",
      "Thine Augustness rule the Dominion of the Night.” Now this was a youth\n",
      "of a fair and pleasant countenance.\n",
      "And to the youngest of the deities, his Augustness the Lord Izanagi gave\n",
      "the Sea Plain.\n",
      "So Ama Terassu ruled the day, and Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami softly ruled the\n",
      "night. But Susa, the Impetuous, flung himself upon the ground and\n",
      "violently wept, for he said, “Ah, miserable, to dwell for ever upon the\n",
      "confines of the cold sea!” So he ceased not in his weeping, and took the\n",
      "moisture of the valley for his tears, so that the green places were\n",
      "withered and the rivers and streams were dried up. And evil deities\n",
      "increased and flourished, and as they swarmed upon the earth their noise\n",
      "was as the noise of flies in the fifth moon; and far and wide there\n",
      "arose portents of woe.\n",
      "Then his father, the Lord of Invitation, came and stood terribly by him\n",
      "and said, “What is this that I do see and hear? Why dost thou not rule\n",
      "the dominions with which I charged thee, but lie here, like a child,\n",
      "with tears and wailings? Answer.”\n",
      "And Susa, the Impetuous, answered, “I wail because I am in misery and\n",
      "love not this place, but would depart to my mother who rules the Nether\n",
      "Distant Land, who is called the Queen of Yomi, the World of the Dead.”\n",
      "Then Izanagi was wroth and expelled him with a divine expulsion, and\n",
      "charged him that he should depart and show his face no more.\n",
      "And Susa, the Impetuous, answered, “So be it. But first I will ascend to\n",
      "High Heaven to take leave of Her Augustness, my sister, who is the Glory\n",
      "of Heaven, and then I will depart.”\n",
      "So he went up to Heaven with a noise and a great speed, and at his going\n",
      "all the mountains shook and every land and country quaked. And Ama\n",
      "Terassu, the Light of Heaven, she also trembled at his coming, and said,\n",
      "“This coming of His Augustness, my brother, is of no good intent, but to\n",
      "lay hold of mine inheritance, and to take it by force. For this alone\n",
      "does he invade the fastness of High Heaven.”\n",
      "And forthwith she divided the hair that hung upon her shoulders and\n",
      "rolled it in two august bunches to the left and to the right, and\n",
      "adorned it with jewels. So she made her head like the head of a young\n",
      "warrior. And she slung upon her back a great bow and a quiver of arrows,\n",
      "one thousand and five hundred arrows, and she took in her hand a bamboo\n",
      "staff and brandished it and stamped upon the ground with her armed feet,\n",
      "so that the earth flew like powdered snow. So she came to the bank of\n",
      "the Tranquil River of Heaven and stood valiantly, like unto a mighty\n",
      "man, and waited.\n",
      "And Susa, the Impetuous, spoke from the farther bank: “My lovely\n",
      "sister, Thine Augustness, why comest thou thus armed against me?”\n",
      "And she answered, “Nay, but wherefore ascendest thou hither?”\n",
      "And Susa replied, “There is nothing evil in my mind. Because I desired\n",
      "to dwell in the Land of Yomi, therefore has my father deigned to expel\n",
      "me with a divine expulsion, and I thought to take leave of thee, and so\n",
      "I have ascended hither. I have no evil intention.”\n",
      "And she, bending her great eyes on him, said “Swear.”\n",
      "And he swore, by the ten-grasp sword that was girded on him, and after\n",
      "that he swore by the jewels in her hair. Then she suffered him to cross\n",
      "over the Tranquil River of Heaven, and also to cross over the Floating\n",
      "Bridge. So Susa, the Impetuous, entered the dominions of his sister, the\n",
      "Sun Goddess.\n",
      "But his wild spirit never ceased to chafe. And he pillaged the fair\n",
      "lands of Ama Terassu and broke down the divisions of the rice-fields\n",
      "which she had planted, and filled in the ditches. Still the Light of\n",
      "Heaven upbraided him not, but said, “His Augustness, my brother,\n",
      "believes that the land should not be wasted by ditches and divisions,\n",
      "and that rice should be sown everywhere, without distinction.” But\n",
      "notwithstanding her soft words Susa, the Impetuous, continued in his\n",
      "evil ways and became more and more violent.\n",
      "Now, as the great Sun Goddess sat with her maidens in the awful Weaving\n",
      "Hall of High Heaven, seeing to the weaving of the august garments of\n",
      "the gods, her brother made a mighty chasm in the roof of the Weaving\n",
      "Hall, and through the chasm he let down a heavenly piebald horse. And\n",
      "the horse fled hither and thither in terror, and wrought great havoc\n",
      "amongst the looms and amongst the weaving maidens. And Susa himself\n",
      "followed like a rushing tempest and like a storm of waters flooding the\n",
      "hall, and all was confusion and horror. And in the press the Sun Goddess\n",
      "was wounded with her golden shuttle. So with a cry she fled from High\n",
      "Heaven and hid herself in a cave; and she rolled a rock across the\n",
      "cave’s mouth.\n",
      "Then dark was the Plain of High Heaven, and black dark the Central Land\n",
      "of Reed Plains, and eternal night prevailed. Hereupon the voices of the\n",
      "deities as they wandered over the face of the earth were like unto the\n",
      "flies in the fifth moon, and from far and near there arose portents of\n",
      "woe. Therefore did the Eight Hundred Myriad Deities assemble with a\n",
      "divine assembly in the dry bed of the Tranquil River of Heaven, there to\n",
      "hold parley, and to make decision what should be done. And His\n",
      "Augustness the Lord of Deep Thoughts commanded them. So they called\n",
      "together the Singing Birds of Eternal Night. And they charged\n",
      "Ama-tsu-mara, the Divine Smith, to make them a mirror of shining white\n",
      "metal. And they charged Tama-noya-no-mikoto to string together many\n",
      "hundreds of curved jewels. And, having performed divination by the\n",
      "shoulder-blade of a stag of Mount Kagu, they uprooted a sacred tree, a\n",
      "_sakaki_, of five hundred branches. And they hung the jewels upon the\n",
      "branches of the tree, and they hung the mirror upon its branches. And\n",
      "all the lower branches they covered with offerings, streamers of white\n",
      "and streamers of blue, and they bore the tree before the rock cavern\n",
      "where the Sun Goddess was. And immediately the assembled birds sang.\n",
      "Then a divine maiden of fair renown, who for grace and skill in dancing\n",
      "had no sister, either in the Land of Rice Ears or upon the Plain of High\n",
      "Heaven, stood before the cavern door. And there was hung about her for a\n",
      "garland the club moss from Mount Kagu, and her head was bound with the\n",
      "leaves of the spindle-tree and with flowers of gold and flowers of\n",
      "silver, and a sheaf of green bamboo-grass was in her hands. And she\n",
      "danced before the cavern door as one possessed, for heaven and earth\n",
      "have not seen the like of her dancing. It was more lovely than the\n",
      "pine-tops waving in the wind or the floating of sea foam, and the cloud\n",
      "race upon the Plain of High Heaven is not to be compared with it. And\n",
      "the earth quaked and High Heaven shook, and all the Eight Hundred Myriad\n",
      "Deities laughed together.\n",
      "Now Ama Terassu, the Glory of Heaven, lay in the rock cavern, and the\n",
      "bright light streamed from her fair body in rays, so that she was as a\n",
      "great jewel of price. And pools of water gleamed in the floor of the\n",
      "cavern, and the slime upon the walls gleamed with many colours, and the\n",
      "small rock-plants flourished in the unwonted heat, so that the heavenly\n",
      "lady lay in a bower and slept. And she awoke because of the song of the\n",
      "Eternal Singing Birds, and she raised herself and flung the hair back\n",
      "over her shoulder, and said, “Alack, the poor birds that sing in the\n",
      "long night!” And there came to her the sound of dancing and of high\n",
      "revel and of the merriment of the gods, so she was still and listened.\n",
      "And presently she felt the Plain of High Heaven shake, and heard the\n",
      "Eight Hundred Myriad Deities as they laughed together. And she arose and\n",
      "came to the door of the cavern, and rolled back the great stone a little\n",
      "way. And a beam of light fell upon the dancing maiden where she stood,\n",
      "panting, in all her array; but the other deities were yet in darkness,\n",
      "and they looked at each other and were still. Then spoke the Fair Glory\n",
      "of Heaven: “Methought that because I was hidden the Plain of High Heaven\n",
      "should be dark, and black dark the Central Land of Reed Plains. How,\n",
      "then, doth the Dancing Maiden go thus, adorned with garlands and her\n",
      "head tired? And why do the Eight Hundred Myriad Deities laugh together?”\n",
      "Then the Dancing Maiden made answer: “O Thine Augustness, that art the\n",
      "sweet delight of all the deities, behold the divine maidens are decked\n",
      "with flowers, and the gods assemble with shouts. We rejoice and are glad\n",
      "because there is a goddess more illustrious than Thine Augustness.”\n",
      "And Ama Terassu heard and was wroth. And she covered her face with her\n",
      "long sleeves, so that the deities should not see her tears; howbeit,\n",
      "they fell like the falling stars. Then the youths of the Court of\n",
      "Heaven stood by the _sakaki_ tree, where hung the mirror that was made\n",
      "by Ama-tsu-Mara, the Divine Smith. And they cried, “Lady, look and\n",
      "behold the new paragon of Heaven!”\n",
      "And Ama Terassu said, “Indeed, I will not behold.” Nevertheless, she\n",
      "presently let slip the sleeves that covered her countenance and looked\n",
      "in the mirror. And as she looked, and beheld, and was dazzled by her own\n",
      "beauty, that was without peer, she came forth slowly from the rocks of\n",
      "the cavern. And the light of her flooded High Heaven, and below the rice\n",
      "ears waved and shook themselves, and the wild cherry rushed into flower.\n",
      "And all the deities joined their hands in a ring about Ama Terassu, the\n",
      "Goddess of the Sun, and the door of the rock cavern was shut. Then the\n",
      "Dancing Maiden cried, “O Lady, Thine Augustness, how should any Deity be\n",
      "born to compare with thee, the Glory of Heaven?”\n",
      "So with joy they bore the goddess to her place.\n",
      "But Susa, the Swift, the Brave, the Impetuous, the Long-Haired, the\n",
      "Thrice Unhappy, the Lord of the Sea, him the deities arraigned to stand\n",
      "trial in the dry bed of the Tranquil River of Heaven. And they took\n",
      "counsel, and fined him with a great fine. And, having shorn him of his\n",
      "hair, which was his beauty and his pride (for it was blue-black as an\n",
      "iris, and hung below his knee), they banished him for ever from the\n",
      "heavenly precincts.\n",
      "So Susa descended to earth by the Floating Bridge with bitterness in his\n",
      "heart, and for many days he wandered in despair, he knew not whither. By\n",
      "fair rice-fields he came, and by barren moors, heeding nothing; and at\n",
      "last he stayed to rest by the side of the river called Hi, which is in\n",
      "the land of Izumo.\n",
      "And as he sat, moody, his head on his hand, and looked down at the\n",
      "water, he beheld a chopstick floating on the surface of the stream. So\n",
      "Susa, the Impetuous, arose immediately, saying, “There are people at the\n",
      "river head.” And he pursued his way up the bank in quest of them. And\n",
      "when he had gone not a great way, he found an old man weeping and\n",
      "lamenting very grievously, among the reeds and willows by the\n",
      "water-side. And there was with him a lady of great state and beauty,\n",
      "like unto the daughter of a deity; but her fair eyes were marred with\n",
      "many tears, and she moaned continually and wrung her hands. And these\n",
      "twain had between them a young maid of very slender and delicate form;\n",
      "but her face Susa could not see, for she covered it with a veil. And\n",
      "ever and anon she moved and trembled with fear, or seemed to beseech the\n",
      "old man earnestly, or plucked the lady by the sleeve; at which these\n",
      "last but shook their heads sorrowfully, and returned to their\n",
      "lamentations.\n",
      "And Susa, full of wonder, drew near and asked the old man, “Who art\n",
      "thou?”\n",
      "And the old man answered, “I am an earthly deity of the mountains. This\n",
      "is my wife, who weeps with me by the water-side, and the child is my\n",
      "youngest daughter.”\n",
      "And Susa inquired of him again, “What is the cause of your weeping and\n",
      "lamentation?”\n",
      "And he answered, “Know, sir, that I am an earthly deity of renown, and I\n",
      "was the father of eight fair daughters. But a horror broods over the\n",
      "land, for every year at this time it is ravaged by a monster, the\n",
      "eight-forked serpent of Koshi, that delights in the flesh of young\n",
      "virgins. In seven years have my seven sweet children been devoured. And\n",
      "now the time of my youngest-born is at hand. Therefore do we weep, O\n",
      "Thine Augustness.”\n",
      "Then said Susa, the Impetuous, “What is the likeness of this monster?”\n",
      "And the deities of the mountain made answer: “His eyes are fiery and red\n",
      "as the _akakagachi_ (that is, the winter cherry). He has but one body,\n",
      "with eight heads and eight scaly tails. Moreover, on his body grows\n",
      "moss, together with the fir and the cryptomeria of the forest. In his\n",
      "going he covers eight valleys and eight hills, and upon his under side\n",
      "he is red and gory.”\n",
      "Then the Lord Susa, the Impetuous, cried, “My lord, give me thy\n",
      "daughter.”\n",
      "And the earthly deity, seeing his strength and great beauty and the\n",
      "brightness of his countenance, knew that he was a god, and answered,\n",
      "“With all reverence do I offer her unto thee. Howbeit, I know not thine\n",
      "august name.”\n",
      "And Susa said, “I am Susa, the Sea God, the exile of High Heaven.”\n",
      "[Illustration: The Story of Susa, the Impetuous.--_P. 99._]\n",
      "And the mountain deity and also his fair wife spoke, saying, “So be it,\n",
      "Thine Augustness, take the young maid.”\n",
      "And immediately Susa flung away the veil and saw the face of his bride,\n",
      "pale as the moon in winter. And he touched her on the forehead, and\n",
      "said, “Fair and beloved, fair and beloved....”\n",
      "And the maid flushed faintly to stand thus barefaced. Howbeit, she had\n",
      "little need, for the tears that stood in my lord Susa’s eyes were veil\n",
      "enough for her modesty. And he said again, “Dear and beautiful, our\n",
      "pleasure shall be hereafter, now we may not tarry.”\n",
      "So he took the young maid at once, and changed her into a crown for his\n",
      "head. And Susa wore the crown gallantly. And he instructed the earthly\n",
      "deity, and together they brewed _saké_, refined eight-fold; and with the\n",
      "_saké_ they filled eight vats and set them in readiness; and when all\n",
      "was prepared they waited. And presently there was a mighty noise, like\n",
      "the sound of an earthquake, and the hills and valleys shook. And the\n",
      "serpent crawled in sight, huge and horrible, so that the earthly deities\n",
      "hid their faces for fear. But Susa, the Impetuous, gazed upon the\n",
      "serpent with his sword drawn.\n",
      "Now the serpent had eight heads, and immediately he dipped a head into\n",
      "each vat of _saké_ and drank long. Thereupon he became drunken with the\n",
      "distilled liquor, and all the heads lay down and slept.\n",
      "Then the Lord Susa brandished his ten-grasp sword, and leapt upon the\n",
      "monster and cut off the eight heads with eight valiant strokes. So the\n",
      "serpent was slain with a great slaying, and the river Hi flowed on, a\n",
      "river of blood. And Susa cut the tails of the serpent also, and as he\n",
      "struck the fourth tail the edge of his august sword was turned back. So\n",
      "he probed with its point, and found a great jewelled sword with a blade\n",
      "sharp as no known smith could temper it. And he took the sword and sent\n",
      "it for an offering to the Sun Goddess, his august sister. This is the\n",
      "herb-quelling sword.\n",
      "And Susa, the Impetuous, built him a palace at the place called Suga,\n",
      "and dwelt there with his bride. And the clouds of heaven hung like a\n",
      "curtain round about the palace. Then the Lord Susa sang this song:\n",

      "There was an old bamboo cutter called Také Tori. He was an honest old\n",
      "man, very poor and hard-working, and he lived with his good old wife in\n",
      "a cottage on the hills. Children they had none, and little comfort in\n",
      "their old age, poor souls.\n",
      "Také Tori rose early upon a summer morning, and went forth to cut\n",
      "bamboos as was his wont, for he sold them for a fair price in the town,\n",
      "and thus he gained his humble living.\n",
      "Up the steep hillside he went, and came to the bamboo grove quite\n",
      "wearied out. He took his blue _tenegui_ and wiped his forehead, “Alack\n",
      "for my old bones!” he said. “I am not so young as I once was, nor the\n",
      "good wife either, and there’s no chick nor child to help us in our old\n",
      "age, more’s the pity.” He sighed as he got to work, poor Také Tori.\n",
      "Soon he saw a bright light shining among the green stems of the bamboos.\n",
      "“What is this?” said Také Tori, for as a rule it was dim and shady\n",
      "enough in the bamboo grove. “Is it the sun?” said Také Tori. “No, that\n",
      "cannot well be, for it comes from the ground.” Very soon he pushed his\n",
      "way through the bamboo stems to see what the bright light came from.\n",
      "Sure enough it came from the root of a great big green bamboo. Také Tori\n",
      "took his axe and cut down the great big green bamboo, and there was a\n",
      "fine shining green jewel, the size of his two fists.\n",
      "“Wonder of wonders!” cried Také Tori. “Wonder of wonders! For\n",
      "five-and-thirty years I’ve cut bamboo. This is the very first time I’ve\n",
      "found a great big green jewel at the root of one of them.” With that he\n",
      "takes up the jewel in his hands, and as soon as he does that, it bursts\n",
      "in two with a loud noise, if you’ll believe it, and out of it came a\n",
      "young person and stood on Také Tori’s hand.\n",
      "You must understand the young person was small but very beautiful. She\n",
      "was dressed all in green silk.\n",
      "“Greetings to you, Také Tori,” she says, as easy as you please.\n",
      "“Mercy me!” says Také Tori. “Thank you kindly. I suppose, now, you’ll be\n",
      "a fairy,” he says, “if I’m not making too bold in asking?”\n",
      "“You’re right,” she says, “it’s a fairy I am, and I’m come to live with\n",
      "you and your good wife for a little.”\n",
      "“Well, now,” says Také Tori, “begging your pardon, we’re very poor. Our\n",
      "cottage is good enough, but I’m afraid there’d be no comforts for a lady\n",
      "like you.”\n",
      "“Where’s the big green jewel?” says the fairy.\n",
      "Take Tori picks up the two halves. “Why, it’s full of gold pieces,” he\n",
      "says.\n",
      "“That will do to go on with,” says the fairy; “and now, Také Tori, let\n",
      "us make for home.”\n",
      "Home they went. “Wife! wife!” cried Také Tori, “here’s a fairy come to\n",
      "live with us, and she has brought us a shining jewel as big as a\n",
      "persimmon, full of gold pieces.”\n",
      "The good wife came running to the door. She could hardly believe her\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "“What is this,” she said, “about a persimmon and gold pieces? Persimmons\n",
      "I have seen often enough--moreover, it is the season--but gold pieces\n",
      "are hard to come by.”\n",
      "“Let be, woman,” said Také Tori, “you are dull.” And he brought the\n",
      "fairy into the house.\n",
      "Wondrous fast the fairy grew. Before many days were gone she was a fine\n",
      "tall maiden, as fresh and as fair as the morning, as bright as the\n",
      "noonday, as sweet and still as the evening, and as deep as the night.\n",
      "Také Tori called her the Lady Beaming Bright, because she had come out\n",
      "of the shining jewel.\n",
      "Take Tori had the gold pieces out of the jewel every day. He grew rich,\n",
      "and spent his money like a man, but there was always plenty and to\n",
      "spare. He built him a fine house, he had servants to wait on him. The\n",
      "Lady Beaming Bright was lodged like an empress. Her beauty was famed\n",
      "both near and far, and scores of lovers came to seek her hand.\n",
      "But she would have none of them. “Také Tori and the dear good wife are\n",
      "my true lovers,” she said; “I will live with them and be their\n",
      "daughter.”\n",
      "So three happy years went by; and in the third year the Mikado himself\n",
      "came to woo the Lady Beaming Bright. He was the brave lover, indeed.\n",
      "“Lady,” he said, “I bow before you, my soul salutes you. Sweet lady, be\n",
      "my Queen.”\n",
      "Then the Lady Beaming Bright sighed and great tears stood in her eyes,\n",
      "and she hid her face with her sleeve.\n",
      "“Lord, I cannot,” she said.\n",
      "“Cannot?” said the Mikado; “and why not, O dear Lady Beaming Bright?”\n",
      "“Wait and see, lord,” she said.\n",
      "Now about the seventh month she grew very sorrowful, and would go abroad\n",
      "no more, but was for long upon the garden gallery of Také Tori’s house.\n",
      "There she sat in the daytime and brooded. There she sat at night and\n",
      "gazed upon the moon and the stars. There she was one fine night when the\n",
      "moon was at its full. Her maidens were with her, and Také Tori and the\n",
      "good wife, and the Mikado, her brave lover.\n",
      "“How bright the moon shines!” said Také Tori.\n",
      "“Truly,” said the good wife, “it is like a brass saucepan well scoured.”\n",
      "“See how pale and wan it is,” said the Mikado; “it is like a sad\n",
      "despairing lover.”\n",
      "“How long and bright a beam!” quoth Také Tori. “It is like a highway\n",
      "from the moon reaching to this garden gallery.”\n",
      "“O dear foster-father,” cried the Lady Beaming Bright. “You speak truth,\n",
      "it is a highway indeed. And along the highway come countless heavenly\n",
      "beings swiftly, swiftly, to bear me home. My father is the King of the\n",
      "Moon. I disobeyed his behest. He sent me to earth three years to dwell\n",
      "in exile. The three years are past and I go to mine own country. Ah, I\n",
      "am sad at parting.”\n",
      "“The mist descends,” said Také Tori.\n",
      "“Nay,” said the Mikado, “it is the cohorts of the King of the Moon.”\n",
      "Down they came in their hundreds and their thousands, bearing torches.\n",
      "Silently they came, and lighted round about the garden gallery. The\n",
      "chief among them brought a heavenly feather robe. Up rose the Lady\n",
      "Beaming Bright and put the robe upon her.\n",
      "“Farewell, Také Tori,” she said, “farewell, dear foster-mother, I leave\n",
      "you my jewel for a remembrance.... As for you, my lord, I would you\n",
      "might come with me--but there is no feather robe for you. I leave you a\n",
      "phial of the pure elixir of life. Drink, my lord, and be even as the\n",
      "Immortals.”\n",
      "Then she spread her bright wings and the cohorts of Heaven closed about\n",
      "her. Together they passed up the highway to the moon, and were no more\n",
      "seen.\n",
      "The Mikado took the elixir of life in his hand, and he went to the top\n",
      "of the highest mountain in that country. And he made a great fire to\n",
      "consume the elixir of life, for he said, “Of what profit shall it be to\n",
      "me to live for ever, being parted from the Lady Beaming Bright?”\n",
      "So the elixir of life was consumed, and its blue vapour floated up to\n",
      "Heaven. And the Mikado said, “Let my message float up with the vapour\n",
      "and reach the ears of my Lady Beaming Bright.”\n",

      "The young man, Ito Tatewaki, was returning homeward after a journey\n",
      "which he had taken to the city of Kioto. He made his way alone and on\n",
      "foot, and he went with his eyes bent upon the ground, for cares weighed\n",
      "him down and his mind was full of the business which had taken him to\n",
      "Kioto. Night found him upon a lonely road leading across a wild moor.\n",
      "Upon the moor were rocks and stones, with an abundance of flowers, for\n",
      "it was summer time, and here and there grew a dark pine tree, with\n",
      "gnarled trunk and crooked boughs.\n",
      "Tatewaki looked up and beheld the figure of a woman before him in the\n",
      "way. It was a slender girl dressed in a simple gown of blue cotton.\n",
      "Lightly she went along the lonely road in the deepening twilight.\n",
      "“I should say she was the serving-maid of some gentle lady,” Tatewaki\n",
      "said to himself. “The way is solitary and the time is dreary for such a\n",
      "child as she.”\n",
      "So the young man quickened his pace and came up with the maiden.\n",
      "“Child,” he said very gently, “since we tread the same lonely road let\n",
      "us be fellow-travellers, for now the twilight passes and it will soon be\n",
      "dark.”\n",
      "The pretty maiden turned to him with bright eyes and smiling lips.\n",
      "“Sir,” she said, “my mistress will be glad indeed.”\n",
      "“Your mistress?” said Tatewaki.\n",
      "“Why, sir, of a surety she will be glad because you are come.”\n",
      "“Because I am come?”\n",
      "“Indeed, and indeed the time has been long,” said the serving-maid; “but\n",
      "now she will think no more of that.”\n",
      "“Will she not?” said Tatewaki. And on he went by the maiden’s side,\n",
      "walking as one in a dream.\n",
      "Presently the two of them came to a little house, not far from the\n",
      "roadside. Before the house was a small fair garden, with a stream\n",
      "running through it and a stone bridge. About the house and the garden\n",
      "there was a bamboo fence, and in the fence a wicket-gate.\n",
      "“Here dwells my mistress,” said the serving-maid. And they went into the\n",
      "garden through the wicket-gate.\n",
      "Now Tatewaki came to the threshold of the house. He saw a lady standing\n",
      "upon the threshold waiting.\n",
      "She said, “You have come at last, my lord, to give me comfort.”\n",
      "And he answered, “I have come.”\n",
      "When he had said this he knew that he loved the lady, and had loved her\n",
      "since love was.\n",
      "“O love, love,” he murmured, “time is not for such as we.”\n",
      "Then she took him by the hand, and they went into the house together and\n",
      "into a room with white mats and a round latticed window.\n",
      "Before the window there stood a lily in a vessel of water.\n",
      "Here the two held converse together.\n",
      "And after some time there was an old ancient woman that came with _saké_\n",
      "in a silver flagon; and she brought silver drinking-cups and all things\n",
      "needful. And Tatewaki and the lady drank the “Three Times Three”\n",
      "together. When they had done this the lady said, “Love, let us go out\n",
      "into the shine of the moon. See, the night is as green as an\n",
      "emerald....”\n",
      "So they went and left the house and the small fair garden behind them.\n",
      "Or ever they had closed the wicket-gate the house and the garden and the\n",
      "wicket-gate itself all faded away, dissolving in a faint mist, and not a\n",
      "sign of them was left.\n",
      "“Alas! what is this?” cried Tatewaki.\n",
      "“Let be, dear love,” said the lady, and smiled; “they pass, for we have\n",
      "no more need of them.”\n",
      "Then Tatewaki saw that he was alone with the lady upon the wild moor.\n",
      "And the tall lilies grew about them in a ring. So they stood the\n",
      "live-long night, not touching one another but looking into each other’s\n",
      "eyes most steadfastly. When dawn came, the lady stirred and gave one\n",
      "deep sigh.\n",
      "Tatewaki said, “Lady, why do you sigh?”\n",
      "And when he asked her this, she unclasped her girdle, which was\n",
      "fashioned after the form of a golden scaled dragon with translucent\n",
      "eyes. And she took the girdle and wound it nine times about her love’s\n",
      "arm, and she said, “O love, we part: these are the years until we meet\n",
      "again.” So she touched the golden circles on his arm.\n",
      "Then Tatewaki cried aloud, “O love, who are you? Tell me your name....”\n",
      "She said, “O love, what have we to do with names, you and I?... I go to\n",
      "my people upon the plains. Do not seek for me there.... Wait for me.”\n",
      "And when the lady had spoken she faded slowly and grew ethereal, like a\n",
      "mist. And Tatewaki cast himself upon the ground and put out his hand to\n",
      "hold her sleeve. But he could not stay her. And his hand grew cold and\n",
      "he lay still as one dead, all in the grey dawn.\n",
      "When the sun was up he arose.\n",
      "“The plains,” he said, “the low plains ... there will I find her.” So,\n",
      "with the golden token wound about his arm, fleetly he sped down, down to\n",
      "the plains. He came to the broad river, where he saw folk standing on\n",
      "the green banks. And on the river there floated boats of fresh flowers,\n",
      "the red dianthus and the campanula, golden rod and meadow-sweet. And the\n",
      "people upon the river banks called to Tatewaki:\n",
      "“Stay with us. Last night was the Night of Souls. They came to earth and\n",
      "wandered where they would, the kind wind carried them. To-day they\n",
      "return to Yomi. They go in their boats of flowers, the river bears them.\n",
      "Stay with us and bid the departing Souls good speed.”\n",
      "And Tatewaki cried, “May the Souls have sweet passage.... I cannot\n",
      "stay.”\n",
      "So he came to the plains at last, but did not find his lady. Nothing at\n",
      "all did he find, but a wilderness of ancient graves, with nettles\n",
      "overgrown and the waving green grass.\n",
      "So Tatewaki went to his own place, and for nine long years he lived a\n",
      "lonely man. The happiness of home and little children he never knew.\n",
      "“Ah, love,” he said, “not patiently, not patiently, I wait for you....\n",
      "Love, delay not your coming.”\n",
      "And when the nine years were past he was in his garden upon the Night of\n",
      "Souls. And looking up he saw a woman that came towards him, threading\n",
      "her way through the paths of the garden. Lightly she came; she was a\n",
      "slender girl, dressed in a simple gown of blue cotton. Tatewaki stood up\n",
      "and spoke:\n",
      "“Child,” he said very gently, “since we tread the same lonely road let\n",
      "us be fellow-travellers, for now the twilight passes and it will soon be\n",
      "dark.”\n",
      "The maid turned to him with bright eyes and smiling lips:\n",
      "“Sir,” she said, “my mistress will be glad indeed.”\n",
      "“Will she be glad?” said Tatewaki.\n",
      "“The time has been long.”\n",
      "“Long and very weary,” said Tatewaki.\n",
      "“But now you will think no more of that....”\n",

      "THE SAD STORY OF THE YAOYA’S DAUGHTER\n",
      "There was a wandering ballad-singer who came to a great house in Yedo\n",
      "where they wished to be entertained.\n",
      "“Will you have a dance or a song?” said the ballad-singer; “or shall I\n",
      "tell you a story?” The people of the house bade him tell a story.\n",
      "“Shall it be a tale of love or a tale of war?” said the ballad-singer.\n",
      "“Oh, a tale of love,” they said.\n",
      "“Will you have a sad tale or a merry?” asked the ballad-singer.\n",
      "They were all agreed that they would hear a sad tale.\n",
      "“Well, then,” said the ballad-singer, “listen, and I will tell you the\n",
      "sad story of the Yaoya’s daughter.”\n",
      "So he told this tale.\n",
      "*       *       *       *       *\n",
      "The Yaoya was a poor hard-working man, but his daughter was the sweetest\n",
      "thing in Yedo. You must know she was one of the five beauties of the\n",
      "city, that grew like five cherry-trees in the time of the spring\n",
      "blossoming.\n",
      "In autumn the hunters lure the wild deer with the sound of the flute.\n",
      "The deer are deceived, for they believe that they hear the voices of\n",
      "their mates. So are they trapped and slain. For like calls to like.\n",
      "Youth calls to youth, beauty to beauty, love to love. This is law, and\n",
      "this law was the undoing of the Yaoya’s daughter.\n",
      "When there was a great fire in Yedo, so great that more than the half of\n",
      "the city was burned, the Yaoya’s house was ruined also. And the Yaoya\n",
      "and his wife and his daughter had no roof over them, nor anywhere to lay\n",
      "their heads. So they went to a Buddhist temple for shelter and stayed\n",
      "there many days, till their house should be rebuilt. Ah me, for the\n",
      "Yaoya’s daughter! Every morning at sunrise she bathed in the spring of\n",
      "clean water that was near the temple. Her eyes were bright and her\n",
      "cheeks ruddy. Then she would put on her blue gown and sit by the\n",
      "water-side to comb her long hair. She was a sweet and slender thing,\n",
      "scarce fifteen years old. Her name was O Schichi.\n",
      "“Sweep the temple and the temple courts,” her father bade her. “’Tis\n",
      "well we should do so much for the good priests who give us shelter.” So\n",
      "O Schichi took the broom and swept. And as she laboured she sang\n",
      "merrily, and the grey precincts of the temple grew bright.\n",
      "Now there was a young acolyte who served in the holy place. Gentle he\n",
      "was and beautiful. Not a day passed but he heard the singing of O\n",
      "Schichi; not a day passed but he set eyes upon her, going her ways, so\n",
      "light and slender, in the ancient courts of the temple.\n",
      "It was not long before he loved her. Youth calls to youth, beauty to\n",
      "beauty, love to love. It was not long before she loved him.\n",
      "Secretly they met together in the temple grove. Hand in hand they went,\n",
      "her head against his arm.\n",
      "“Ah,” she cried, “that such a thing should be! I am happy and unhappy.\n",
      "Why do I love you, my own?”\n",
      "“Because of the power of Karma,” said the acolyte. “Nevertheless, we\n",
      "sin, O heart’s desire, grievously we sin, and I know not what may come\n",
      "of it.”\n",
      "“Alas,” she said, “will the gods be angry with us, and we so young?”\n",
      "“I cannot tell,” he said; “but I am afraid.”\n",
      "Then the two of them clung together, trembling and weeping. But they\n",
      "pledged themselves to each other for the space of many existences.\n",
      "The Yaoya had his dwelling in the quarter of the city called Honjo, and\n",
      "presently his house was rebuilt which had been destroyed by the fire. He\n",
      "and his wife were glad, for they said, “Now we shall go home.”\n",
      "O Schichi hid her face with her sleeve and wept bitter tears.\n",
      "“Child, what ails you?” said her mother.\n",
      "O Schichi wept. “Oh! oh! oh!” she cried, and swayed herself to and fro.\n",
      "“Why, maid, what is it?” said her father.\n",
      "Still O Schichi wept. “Oh! oh! oh!” she cried, and swayed herself to and\n",
      "fro.\n",
      "That night she went to the grove. There was the acolyte, very pale and\n",
      "sorrowful, beneath the trees.\n",
      "“They will part us,” she cried, “O my dear heart’s desire. The dear gods\n",
      "are angry with us, and we so young.”\n",
      "“Ah,” he said, “I was afraid.... Farewell, dear maid, O little maid,\n",
      "sweet and slender. Remember we are pledged to one another for the space\n",
      "of many existences.”\n",
      "Then the two of them clung together, trembling and weeping, and they\n",
      "bade farewell a thousand times.\n",
      "The next day they bore O Schichi home to Honjo. She grew languid and\n",
      "listless. White she grew, white as the buckwheat flower. She drooped and\n",
      "she failed. No longer was she numbered with the five beauties of Yedo,\n",
      "nor likened to a cherry-tree in the time of the spring blossoming. All\n",
      "the day long she brooded silently. At night she lay awake in her low\n",
      "bed.\n",
      "“Oh! oh!” she moaned, “the weary, weary night! Shall I never see him?\n",
      "Must I die of longing? Oh! oh! the weary, weary night....”\n",
      "Her eyes grew large and burning bright.\n",
      "“Alas! poor maid,” said her father.\n",
      "“I am afraid ...” said her mother. “She will lose her wits.... She does\n",
      "not weep any more.”\n",
      "At last O Schichi arose and took straw and made it into a bundle; and\n",
      "she put charcoal in the bundle and laid it beneath the gallery of her\n",
      "father’s house. Then she set fire to the straw and the charcoal, and the\n",
      "whole burnt merrily. Furthermore the wood of her father’s house took\n",
      "light and the house was burnt to the ground.\n",
      "“I shall see him; I shall see him!” shrieked O Schichi, and fell in a\n",
      "swoon.\n",
      "Howbeit all the city knew that she had set fire to her father’s house.\n",
      "So she was taken before the judge to be tried for her wrong-doing.\n",
      "“Child,” said the judge, “what made you do this thing?”\n",
      "“I was mad,” she said, “I did it for love’s sake. I said, ‘I will burn\n",
      "the house, we shall have nowhere to lay our heads, then we shall take\n",
      "shelter at the temple; I will see my lover.’ Lord, I have not seen him\n",
      "nor heard of him these many, many moons.”\n",
      "“Who is your lover?” said the judge.\n",
      "Then she told him.\n",
      "Now as for the law of the city, it was hard and could not be altered.\n",
      "Death was the penalty for the crime of the Yaoya’s daughter. Only a\n",
      "child might escape.\n",
      "“My little maid,” the judge said, “are you perhaps twelve years old?”\n",
      "“Nay, lord,” she answered.\n",
      "“Thirteen, then, or fourteen? The gods send you may be fourteen. You are\n",
      "little and slender.”\n",
      "“Lord,” she said, “I am fifteen.”\n",
      "“Alas, my poor maid,” said the judge, “you are all too old.”\n",
      "So they made her stand upon the bridge of Nihonbashi. And they told her\n",
      "story aloud; they called it from the house-tops so that all might hear.\n",
      "There she was for all the world to look upon.\n",
      "Every day for seven days she stood upon the bridge of Nihonbashi, and\n",
      "drooped in the glare of the sun and of men’s glances. Her face was white\n",
      "as the flower of the buckwheat. Her eyes were wide and burning bright.\n",
      "She was the most piteous thing under the sky. The tender-hearted wept to\n",
      "see her. They said, “Is this the Yaoya’s daughter that was one of the\n",
      "five beauties of Yedo?”\n",
      "After the seven days were passed they bound O Schichi to a stake, and\n",
      "they piled faggots of wood about her and set the faggots alight. Soon\n",
      "the thick smoke rose.\n",
      "“It was all for love,” she cried with a loud voice. And when she had\n",

      "This is a tale beloved by the children of Japan, and by the old folk--a\n",
      "tale of magical jewels and a visit to the Sea King’s palace.\n",
      "Prince Rice-Ear-Ruddy-Plenty loved a beautiful and royal maiden, and\n",
      "made her his bride. And the lady was called Princess Blossoming-\n",
      "Brightly-as-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees, so sweetly fair was\n",
      "she. But her father was augustly wrath at her betrothal, for his\n",
      "Augustness, Prince Rice-Ear-Ruddy-Plenty, had put aside her elder\n",
      "sister, the Princess of the Rocks (and, indeed, this lady was not fair),\n",
      "for he loved only Princess Blossoming-Brightly. So the old King said,\n",
      "“Because of this, the offspring of these heavenly deities shall be\n",
      "frail, fading and falling like the flowers of the trees.” So it is. At\n",
      "this day, the lives of their Augustnesses, the Heavenly Sovereigns, are\n",
      "not long.\n",
      "Howbeit, in the fullness of time, the lady,\n",
      "Blossoming-Brightly-as-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees, bore two lovely men\n",
      "children, and called the elder Fire Flash and the younger Fire Fade.\n",
      "Prince Fire Flash was a fisherman, who got his luck upon the wide sea,\n",
      "and ran upon the shore with his august garments girded. And again, he\n",
      "tarried all the night in his boat, upon the high wave-crests. And he\n",
      "caught things broad of fin and things narrow of fin, and he was a deity\n",
      "of the water weeds and of the waters and of the fishes of the sea.\n",
      "But Prince Fire Fade was a hunter, who got his luck upon the mountains\n",
      "and in the forest, who bound sandals fast upon his feet, and bore a bow\n",
      "and heavenly-feathered arrows. And he caught things rough of hair and\n",
      "things soft of hair, and he knew the trail of the badger and the wild\n",
      "cherry’s time of flowering. For he was a deity of the woods.\n",
      "Now Prince Fire Fade spoke to his elder brother, Prince Fire Flash, and\n",
      "said, “Brother, I am aweary of the green hills. Therefore let us now\n",
      "exchange our luck. Give me thy rod and I will go to the cool waters.\n",
      "Thou mayest take my great bow and all my heavenly-feathered arrows and\n",
      "try the mountains, where, trust me, thou shalt see many strange and\n",
      "beautiful things, unknown to thee before.”\n",
      "But Prince Fire Flash answered, “Not so ... not so.”\n",
      "And again, after not many days were past, Prince Fire Fade came and\n",
      "sighed, “I am aweary of the green hills ... the fair waters call me.\n",
      "Woe to be a younger brother!” And when Prince Fire Flash took no heed of\n",
      "him, but angled with his rod, day and night, and caught things broad of\n",
      "fin and things narrow of fin, Prince Fire Fade drooped with desire, and\n",
      "let his long hair fall untended upon his shoulders. And he murmured,\n",
      "“Oh, to try my luck upon the sea!” till at last Prince Fire Flash, his\n",
      "elder brother, gave him the rod for very weariness, and betook himself\n",
      "to the mountains. And all day he hunted, and let fly the\n",
      "heavenly-feathered arrows; but rough of hair or soft of hair, never a\n",
      "thing did he catch. And he cried, “Fool, fool, to barter the heavenly\n",
      "luck of the gods!” So he returned.\n",
      "And his Augustness, Prince Fire Fade, took the luck of the sea, and\n",
      "angled in sunshine and in gloom; but broad of fin or narrow of fin,\n",
      "never a fish did he catch. And, moreover, he lost his brother’s\n",
      "fish-hook in the sea. So he hung his head, and returned.\n",
      "And Prince Fire Flash said, “Each to his own, the hunter to the\n",
      "mountain, and the fisherman to the sea ... for thou and I have brought\n",
      "nothing home, and this night we sleep hungry. We may not barter the luck\n",
      "of the gods. And now, where is my fish-hook?”\n",
      "So Prince Fire Fade replied, saying softly, “Sweet brother, be not angry\n",
      "... but, toiling all day with thy fish-hook, broad of fin or narrow of\n",
      "fin, not a fish did I catch; and, at the last, I lost thy fish-hook in\n",
      "the sea.”\n",
      "At this his Highness, Prince Fire Flash, flew into a great rage, and\n",
      "stamping his feet, required the fish-hook of his brother.\n",
      "And Prince Fire Fade made answer, “Sweet brother, I have not thy\n",
      "fish-hook, but the deep sea, whose bottom no man may search. Though I\n",
      "should die for thee, yet could I not give thee back thy fish-hook.”\n",
      "But his elder brother required it of him the more urgently.\n",
      "Then Prince Fire Fade burst the wild wistaria tendrils which bound his\n",
      "august ten-grasp sword to his side. And he said, “Farewell, good sword.”\n",
      "And he broke it into many fragments, and made five hundred fish-hooks to\n",
      "give to his brother, Prince Fire Flash. But Prince Fire Flash would have\n",
      "none of them.\n",
      "And again Prince Fire Fade toiled at a great furnace, and made one\n",
      "thousand fish-hooks; and upon his knees he humbly offered them to his\n",
      "brother, Prince Fire Flash. For he loved his brother. Nevertheless\n",
      "Prince Fire Flash would not so much as look at them, but sat moody, his\n",
      "head on his hand, saying, “Mine own lost fish-hook will I have, that and\n",
      "no other.”\n",
      "So Prince Fire Fade went grieving from the palace gates, and wandered\n",
      "lamenting by the seashore; and his tears fell and mingled with the foam.\n",
      "And, when night came, he had no heart to return homewards, but sat down,\n",
      "weary, upon a rock amid the salt pools. And he cried, “Alas, my brother,\n",
      "I am all to blame, and through my foolishness has this come upon me. But\n",
      "oh, my brother, together were we nursed upon the sweet breast of our\n",
      "mother, Princess Blossoming-Brightly-as-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees, for\n",
      "almost hand in hand did we come into the world.”\n",
      "And the moon rose so that the sea and the Central Land of Reed Plains\n",
      "was light. But Prince Fire Fade ceased not to lament.\n",
      "Then Shiko-Tsuchi-no-Kami, the Lord of Sea Salt, came with the rising\n",
      "tide, and spoke, “Wherefore weeps the Heaven’s Sky Height?”\n",
      "And Prince Fire Fade made answer: “I have taken my brother’s fish-hook,\n",
      "and I have lost it in the sea. And though I have given him many other\n",
      "fish-hooks for compensation, he will have none of them, but desires only\n",
      "the original fish-hook. Truly, the gods know, I would give my life to\n",
      "find it; but how should that serve?”\n",
      "And Shiko-Tsuchi-no-Kami took him by the sleeve to where a boat moved\n",
      "upon the water, and set him in the boat and pushed it from the shore,\n",
      "saying, “My son, pursue the pleasant path that Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami, His\n",
      "Augustness, the Moon Night Possessor, has made for thee upon the waters.\n",
      "And, at the end, thou shalt come to a palace made of fishes’ scales,\n",
      "which is the palace of the great King of the Sea. Before the gate there\n",
      "is a clear well, and by the well-side there grows a cassia tree with\n",
      "many spreading branches. Therefore climb thou into the branches of the\n",
      "cassia tree, and there wait for the King’s daughter, who shall come to\n",
      "give thee counsel.”\n",
      "And Prince Fire Fade, standing up in the boat, made obeisance, and\n",
      "thanked the Lord of Sea Salt. But this one girded his august garments\n",
      "and pushed the boat before him, till he was thigh-deep in the water. And\n",
      "he said, “Nay, nay, fair youth, no thanks, only do my bidding.”\n",
      "So his Augustness, Prince Fire Fade, came to the Sea King’s palace. And\n",
      "he forthwith climbed the cassia tree and waited among its green\n",
      "branches.\n",
      "At the day’s dawning came the handmaidens of the Sea King’s daughter,\n",
      "with their jewelled vessels, to draw water from the well. And as they\n",
      "stooped to dip their vessels, Prince Fire Fade leaned and watched them\n",
      "from the branches of the cassia tree. And the glory of his august\n",
      "countenance made a brightness upon the waters of the well. So all the\n",
      "maidens looked up and beheld his comeliness, and were amazed. But he\n",
      "spoke them fairly, and desired of them a little water from their\n",
      "vessels. So the maidens drew him water in a jewelled cup (howbeit the\n",
      "jewels were clouded, because of the coldness of the well water), and\n",
      "they presented it to him with all reverence. Then, not drinking the\n",
      "water, Prince Fire Fade took the royal jewel from his neck, and holding\n",
      "it between his two lips he dropped it into the cup, and the cup he gave\n",
      "again to the maidens.\n",
      "Now they saw the great jewel shining in the cup, but they could not move\n",
      "it, for it clung fast to the gold. So the maidens departed, skimming the\n",
      "water like the white birds of the offing. And they came to the Sea\n",
      "King’s daughter, bearing the cup and the jewel in it.\n",
      "And the Princess, looking at the jewel, asked them, “Is there,\n",
      "perchance, a stranger at the gate?”\n",
      "And one of the maidens answered, “There is some one sitting in the\n",
      "branches of the cassia tree which is by our well.”\n",
      "And another said, “It is a very beautiful young man.”\n",
      "And another said, “He is even more glorious than our king. And he asked\n",
      "water of us, so we respectfully gave him water in this cup. And he drank\n",
      "none of it, but dropped a jewel into it from his lips. So we have\n",
      "brought them unto Thine Augustness, both the cup and the jewel.”\n",
      "Then the Princess herself took a vessel and went to draw water at the\n",
      "well. And her long sleeves, and certain of the folds of her august\n",
      "garments, floated behind her, and her head was bound with a garland of\n",
      "sea flowers. And coming to the well she looked up through the branches\n",
      "of the cassia tree. And her eyes met the eyes of Prince Fire Fade.\n",
      "And presently she fetched her father, the Sea King, saying, “Father,\n",
      "there is a beautiful person at our gate.” So the Sea King came out and\n",
      "welcomed Prince Fire Fade, and said, “This is the August Child of the\n",
      "Heaven’s Sun Height.” And leading him into his palace he caused the\n",
      "floor to be spread with eight layers of rugs of asses’ skins, and eight\n",
      "layers of rugs of silk, and set the Prince upon them.\n",
      "And that night he made a great banquet, and celebrated the betrothal of\n",
      "Prince Fire Fade to his daughter, the fair Jewel Princess. And for very\n",
      "many days there was held high revel and rejoicing in the Sea King’s\n",
      "palace.\n",
      "But one night, as they took their ease upon the silken floor, and all\n",
      "the fishes of the sea brought rich dishes, and sweetmeats in vessels of\n",
      "gold and coral and jade to set before them, the fair Jewel Princess\n",
      "herself sat at Prince Fire Fade’s right hand to pour the wine into his\n",
      "cup. And the silver scales upon the palace walls glittered in the\n",
      "moonlight. But Prince Fire Fade looked out across the Sea Path and\n",
      "thought of what had gone before, and so heaved a deep sigh.\n",
      "Then the Sea King was troubled, and asked him, saying, “Wherefore dost\n",
      "thou sigh?” But Prince Fire Fade answered nothing.\n",
      "And the fair Jewel Princess, his betrothed wife, came closer, and\n",
      "touched him on the breast, and said softly, “Oh, Thine Augustness, my\n",
      "sweet spouse, art thou not happy in our water palace, where the shadows\n",
      "fall green, that thou lookest so longingly across the Sea Path? Or do\n",
      "our maidens not please thee, who move silently, like the birds of the\n",
      "offing? Oh, my lord, despise me not, but tell me what is in thine\n",
      "heart.”\n",
      "Then Prince Fire Fade answered, “My lovely lady, Thine Augustness, let\n",
      "nothing be hidden from thee, because of our love.” And he told them all\n",
      "the story of the fish-hook, and of his elder brother’s wrath.\n",
      "[Illustration: The Sea King and the Magic Jewels.--_P. 45._]\n",
      "“And now,” he said, “will the Jewel Princess give me counsel?”\n",
      "Then the Jewel Princess smiled, and rose up lightly, and her hair was so\n",
      "long that it hung to the edge and hem of her silken red robe. And she\n",
      "passed to where the palace steps led down into the water. And standing\n",
      "upon the last step she called to the fishes of the sea, and summoned\n",
      "them, great and small, from far and near. So the fishes of the sea, both\n",
      "great and small, swam about her feet, and the water was silver with\n",
      "their scales. And the King’s daughter cried, “O fishes of the sea, find\n",
      "and bring me the august fish-hook of Prince Fire Flash.”\n",
      "And the fishes answered, “Lady, the _Tai_ is in misery, for something\n",
      "sticks in his throat so that he cannot eat. Perchance this may be the\n",
      "august fish-hook of his Augustness, Prince Fire Flash.”\n",
      "Then the Princess stooped down and lifted the _Tai_ from the water, and\n",
      "with her white hand she took the lost fish-hook from his throat. And\n",
      "after she had washed and dabbled it for a little, she took it in to\n",
      "Prince Fire Fade. And he rejoiced and said, “This is indeed my brother’s\n",
      "fish-hook. I go to restore it instantly, and we shall be reconciled.”\n",
      "For he loved his brother.\n",
      "But the fair Jewel Princess stood silent and sorrowing, for she thought,\n",
      "“Now will he depart and leave me lonely.”\n",
      "And Prince Fire Fade hastened to the water’s edge, and there bestrode a\n",
      "valiant crocodile, who should bring him to his journey’s end. And ere\n",
      "he went, the Sea King spoke: “Fair youth, now listen to my counsel. If\n",
      "thy brother sow rice upon the uplands, do thou sow thy rice low, in the\n",
      "water meads. But if thy brother sow his rice in the water meads, then do\n",
      "thou, Thine Augustness, sow thy rice upon the uplands. And I who rule\n",
      "the rains and the floods will continually prosper the labours of Thine\n",
      "Augustness. Moreover, here are two magic jewels. If thy brother should\n",
      "be moved by envy to attack thee, then put forth the Tide Flowing Jewel\n",
      "and the waters shall arise to drown him. But if thou shouldst have\n",
      "compassion upon him, then put forth the Tide Ebbing Jewel, and all the\n",
      "waters shall subside, and his life be spared.”\n",
      "And his Augustness Prince Fire Fade gave thanks with obeisance. And he\n",
      "hid the fish-hook in his long sleeve, and hung the two great jewels\n",
      "about his neck. Then the fair Jewel Princess came near and bade him\n",
      "farewell, with many tears. And the Sea King charged the crocodile,\n",
      "saying, “While crossing the middle of the sea, do not alarm him.”\n",
      "So Prince Fire Fade sat upon the crocodile’s head; and in one day he\n",
      "came to his own place and sprang lightly to shore. And unsheathing his\n",
      "dagger, he hung it upon the crocodile’s neck for a token.\n",
      "Hereupon, Prince Fire Fade found his brother, and gave him back his own\n",
      "fish-hook that had been lost. Nevertheless, because of the two great\n",
      "jewels, which he wore in the folds of his raiment, he had everlasting\n",
      "dominion over his brother, and flourished in all his doings.\n",
      "And, after some time, there came to Prince Fire Fade the daughter of the\n",
      "Sea King, the fair Jewel Princess. And she came across the Sea Path\n",
      "bearing in her arms a young child. And she, weeping, laid down the child\n",
      "at the feet of His Augustness and said, “My lord, I have brought thy\n",
      "son.”\n",
      "But Prince Fire Fade raised her up and made her welcome, and built for\n",
      "her a palace on the seashore, at the limit of the waves. And the palace\n",

      "Path a highway between thy land and mine, that we might go and come at\n",
      "pleasure. But now, though I warned thee, thou hast looked upon me in the\n",

      "pomegranate. And all the while sweet music sounded.\n",
      "“This is never Mio Strand,” cried the fisherman, bewildered, “where I\n",

      "“Thanks be,” he said, and lifting his eyes he saw a robe of feathers\n",
      "hanging upon the branch of a pine tree. In the robe were feathers of\n",
      "all the birds that fly, every one; the kingfisher and the golden\n",

      "“Ah, the warm, sweet, fairy thing!” said the fisherman; “I’ll take it\n",
      "home for a treasure, sure no money could buy it, and I’ll show it to all\n",
      "the folk of the village.” And off he set for home with the fairy\n",

      "“You must dance the mystic dance that makes the Palace of the Moon turn\n",

      "Then he gave her the robe.\n",
      "Now, when she had arrayed herself and flung back her hair, the Fairy\n",
      "began to dance upon the yellow sand. In and out of the feather robe\n",
      "crept her fairy feet. Slowly, softly, she went with folded wings and\n",
      "sang:\n",

      "The Fairy laughed. Her feet touched the waves of the sea; her feet\n",

      "branches of the pines and then the white clouds.\n",
      "“Farewell, fisherman!” the Fairy cried, and he saw her no more.\n",
      "Long, long he stood gazing up into the sky. At length he stooped and\n",
      "picked up a little feather from the shore, a grey dove’s feather. He\n",

      "Ama Terassu, the Glorious, the Light of High Heaven, commanded, saying,\n",
      "“His Augustness, my August Child, who is called the Conqueror, shall\n",
      "descend to the land. For it is a Land of Luxuriant Reed Plains, a Land\n",
      "of Fresh Rice Ears, a Land of a Thousand Autumns. So of this land he\n",
      "shall be king.”\n",
      "Now his Augustness, the August Child, the Conqueror, stood upon the\n",
      "Floating Bridge of Heaven and looked down, and he saw that there was a\n",
      "great unquietness upon the Land of the Reed Plains. For earthly deities\n",
      "made strife, and blood ran, and fearful sounds of war arose, even to\n",
      "High Heaven. So the August Child, the heavenly born, turned back across\n",
      "the Floating Bridge, and swore he would not descend to rule the land\n",
      "until it should be cleansed.\n",
      "And Ama Terassu, the Light of High Heaven, who had the sun set fast\n",
      "between her eyes, bound her head with jewels, and gathered the deities\n",
      "together in a divine assembly, to hold council in the Tranquil River\n",
      "Bed. And she spoke and said, “Who shall subdue the land that I have\n",
      "given to the August Child?”\n",
      "And all the deities cried, “O Thine Augustness, send down the Lord of\n",
      "Spears.” Therefore the Lord of Spears went lightly down by the Floating\n",
      "Bridge; and there were bound upon his back eight hundred spears.\n",
      "Howbeit, he made a truce with the Lord of the Reed Plains and tarried\n",
      "there; and for three years there was no report.\n",
      "Therefore, once more the Queen of Heaven called him whom the gods name\n",
      "Wonderful, and she called the Lord of Deep Thoughts, and likewise she\n",
      "called every deity of Heaven, and they came to council in the Tranquil\n",
      "River Bed, so that upon the sand there was left the print of their\n",
      "august feet. And Ama Terassu said, “Behold now the Lord of Spears is\n",
      "faithless. Whom shall we send to rule the land?” And the Young Prince\n",
      "answered, “O Mother of Heaven, Thine Augustness, send me.” And all the\n",
      "deities assented with one accord and cried, “Send him, send him,” till\n",
      "there was a sound like thunder in the River Bed.\n",
      "So the Young Prince bound on his sandals, and they brought to him the\n",
      "great bow that stands in the Hall of High Heaven, and bestowed it upon\n",
      "him, and they gave him many heavenly-feathered arrows. So they made him\n",
      "ready, and they brought him to the Floating Bridge. And the Young Prince\n",
      "descended lightly, while his garments shone with the glory of Heaven.\n",
      "But when he touched the tops of the high hills, his heart beat fast and\n",
      "his blood ran warm. Therefore he cut the fastening of his sandals and\n",
      "cast them behind him, and he ran upon his bare feet, like an earthly\n",
      "deity, and came to the palace upon the Reed Plains.\n",
      "Now, at the door of the palace the Princess Undershining stood, like a\n",
      "growing flower. So the Young Prince beheld her and loved her, and he\n",
      "built him a dwelling upon the Reed Plains, and took the Princess for his\n",
      "bride. And, because he loved her and her earthly children, he brought no\n",
      "report to High Heaven, and he forgot the waiting deities. For Heaven was\n",
      "vague to him as a dream.\n",
      "But the gods were weary.\n",
      "And Ama Terassu said, “Long, long tarries our messenger, and brings no\n",
      "word again. My Lord, the August Child, waxes impatient; whom now shall\n",
      "we send?” Thereupon, all the deities, and the Lord of Deep Thoughts,\n",
      "replied, “Send down the Singing Bird, the beloved of High Heaven.”\n",
      "So Ama Terassu took the golden Singing Bird, and said, “Sweet music of\n",
      "the divine gods, spread thou thy bright wings, and fly to the Land of\n",
      "Reed Plains, and there search out the Young Prince, the messenger of\n",
      "Heaven, and, when thou hast found him, sing in his ear this song: ‘Ama\n",
      "Terassu, the Goddess of the Sun, has sent me saying, How fares the quest\n",
      "of High Heaven, and how fares the message? Where is the report of the\n",
      "gods?’”\n",
      "So the bird departed, singing. And she came to the Land of the Reed\n",
      "Plains, and perched upon the branch of a fair cassia tree which grew\n",
      "hard by the Young Prince’s dwelling. Day and night, she sang, and the\n",
      "gods in Heaven thought long for their sweet Singing Bird. Howbeit she\n",
      "returned not again, but sat upon the branch of the cassia tree.\n",
      "But the Young Prince gave no heed.\n",
      "And She that Speaketh Evil heard the words that the bird sang. And she\n",
      "whispered in the Young Prince’s ear, “See now, my lord, this is an evil\n",
      "bird, and evil is its cry; therefore take thou thine arrows and go forth\n",
      "and slay it.” So she urged continually, and, by glamour, she prevailed\n",
      "upon him. Then the Young Prince arose, and took his bow and his\n",
      "heavenly-feathered arrows, and he let fly an arrow into the branches of\n",
      "the cassia tree. And suddenly the sweet sound of singing ceased, and the\n",
      "golden bird fell dead, for the aim was true.\n",
      "But the heavenly-feathered arrow took wing and pierced the floor of\n",
      "Heaven, and reached the high place, where sat the Sun Goddess, together\n",
      "with her August Counsellors, in the Tranquil River Bed of Heaven. And\n",
      "the god called Wonderful took up the arrow, and beheld the blood upon\n",
      "its feathers. And the Lord of Deep Thoughts said, “This is the arrow\n",
      "that was given to the Young Prince,” and he showed it to all the\n",
      "deities. And he said, “If the Young Prince has shot this arrow at the\n",
      "evil deities, according to our command, let it do him no hurt. But, if\n",
      "his heart be not pure, then let the Young Prince perish by this arrow.”\n",
      "And he hurled the arrow back to earth.\n",
      "Now the Young Prince lay upon a couch, sleeping. And the arrow fell,\n",
      "and pierced his heart that he died.\n",
      "Yet the sweet Singing Bird of Heaven returned no more; and the gods were\n",
      "sorrowful.\n",
      "Howbeit, the Young Prince lay dead upon his bed; and the wailing of his\n",
      "spouse, the Princess Undershining, re-echoed in the wind, and was heard\n",
      "in Heaven. So the Young Prince’s father descended with cries and\n",
      "lamentations, and there was built a mourning house upon the Land of Reed\n",
      "Plains, and the Young Prince was laid there.\n",
      "And there came to mourn for him the wild goose of the river, and the\n",

      "kindly, I’d sooner have the light basket; it will suit me better to\n",
      "carry--that is, if it’s the same to you,” he says.\n",
      "So he went home with the light basket. When he opened it, wonderful to\n",
      "tell, it was full of gold and silver and tortoise-shell and coral and\n",
      "jade and fine rolls of silk. So the good old man was rich for life.\n",
      "Now, when the bad old woman heard tell of all this, she tied on her\n",
      "sandals and kilted her skirts and took a stout stick in her hand. Over\n",
      "hill and over dale she went, and took the straight road to the sparrow’s\n",
      "house. There was the sparrow, and there were his brothers and sisters\n",
      "and children and his wife and his mother and his mother-in-law and his\n",
      "grandmother. They were not too pleased to see the bad old woman, but\n",
      "they couldn’t do less than ask her in as she’d come so far. They gave\n",
      "her red rice and white rice and _daikon_ and fish, and who knows what\n",
      "besides, and she gobbled it up in a twinkling, and drank a good cup of\n",
      "_saké_. Then up she got. “I can’t waste any more time here,” she says,\n",
      "“so you’d best bring out your presents.”\n",
      "They brought in two wicker baskets.\n",
      "“One of them is heavy,” says the sparrow, “and the other is light. Say,\n",
      "mistress, will you take the heavy basket or the light?”\n",
      "“I’ll take the heavy one,” says the old woman, quick as a thought. So\n",
      "she heaved it up on her back and off she set. Sure enough it was as\n",
      "heavy as lead.\n",
      "When she was gone, Lord! how the sparrows did laugh!\n",
      "No sooner did she reach home than she undid the cords of the basket.\n",
      "“Now for the gold and silver,” she said, and smiled--though she hadn’t\n",
      "smiled for a twelve-month. And she lifted up the lid.\n",
      "“_Ai! Ai! Kowai! Obaké da! Obaké!_” she screeched.\n",
      "The basket was full of ugly imps and elves and pixies and demons and\n",
      "devils. Out they came to tease the old woman, to pull her and to poke\n",
      "her, to push her and to pinch her. She had the fine fright of her life,\n",
      "I warrant you.\n",

      "THE NURSE\n",
      "[Illustration: The Nurse.--_P. 243._]\n",
      "Idé the _samurai_ was wedded to a fair wife and had an only child, a boy\n",
      "called Fugiwaka. Idé was a mighty man of war, and as often as not he was\n",
      "away from home upon the business of his liege lord. So the child\n",
      "Fugiwaka was reared by his mother and by the faithful woman, his nurse.\n",
      "Matsu was her name, which is, in the speech of the country, the Pine\n",
      "Tree. And even as the pine tree, strong and evergreen, was she,\n",
      "unchanging and enduring.\n",
      "In the house of Idé there was a very precious sword. Aforetime a hero of\n",
      "Idé’s clan slew eight-and-forty of his enemies with this sword in one\n",
      "battle. The sword was Idé’s most sacred treasure. He kept it laid away\n",
      "in a safe place with his household gods.\n",
      "Morning and evening the child Fugiwaka came to make salutations before\n",
      "the household gods, and to reverence the glorious memory of his\n",
      "ancestors. And Matsu, the nurse, knelt by his side.\n",
      "Morning and evening, “Show me the sword, O Matsu, my nurse,” said\n",
      "Fugiwaka.\n",
      "And O Matsu made answer, “Of a surety, my lord, I will show it to you.”\n",
      "Then she brought the sword from its place, wrapped in a covering of red\n",
      "and gold brocade. And she drew off the covering and she took the sword\n",
      "from its golden sheath and displayed the bright steel to Fugiwaka. And\n",
      "the child made obeisance till his forehead touched the mats.\n",
      "At bedtime O Matsu sang songs and lullabies. She sang this song:\n",
      "“Sleep, my little child, sweetly sleep--\n",
      "Would you know the secret,\n",
      "The secret of the hare o Nennin Yama?\n",
      "Sleep, my little child, sweetly sleep--\n",
      "You shall know the secret.\n",
      "Oh, the august hare of Nennin Yama,\n",
      "How augustly long are his ears!\n",
      "Why should this be, oh, best beloved?\n",
      "You shall know the secret.\n",
      "His mother ate the bamboo seed.\n",
      "Hush! Hush!\n",
      "His mother ate the loquat seed.\n",
      "Hush! Hush!\n",
      "Sleep, my little child, sweetly sleep--\n",
      "Now you know the secret.”\n",
      "Then O Matsu said, “Will you sleep now, my lord Fugiwaka?”\n",
      "And the child answered, “I will sleep now, O Matsu.”\n",
      "“Listen, my lord,” she said, “and, sleeping or waking, remember. The\n",
      "sword is your treasure. The sword is your trust. The sword is your\n",
      "fortune. Cherish it, guard it, keep it.”\n",
      "“Sleeping or waking, I will remember,” said Fugiwaka.\n",
      "Now in an evil day the mother of Fugiwaka fell sick and died. And there\n",
      "was mourning in the house of Idé. Howbeit, when years were past, the\n",
      "_samurai_ took another bride, and he had a son by her and called him\n",
      "Goro. And after this Idé himself was slain in an ambush, and his\n",
      "retainers brought his body home and laid him with his fathers.\n",
      "Fugiwaka was chief of the House of Idé. But the Lady Sadako, his\n",
      "stepmother, was ill-pleased. Black mischief stirred in her heart; she\n",
      "bent her brows and she brooded as she went her ways, bearing her babe in\n",
      "her arms. At night she tossed upon her bed.\n",
      "“My child is a beggar,” she said. “Fugiwaka is chief of the House of\n",
      "Idé. Evil fortune betide him! It is too much,” said the proud lady. “I\n",
      "will not brook it; my child a beggar! I would rather strangle him with\n",
      "my hands....” Thus she spoke and tossed upon her bed, thinking of a\n",
      "plan.\n",
      "When Fugiwaka was fifteen years old she turned him out of the house with\n",
      "a poor garment upon his back, barefooted, with never a bite nor a sup\n",
      "nor a gold piece to see him on his way.\n",
      "“Ah, lady mother,” he said, “you use me ill. Why do you take my\n",
      "birthright?”\n",
      "“I know nought of birthrights,” she said. “Go, make your own fortune if\n",
      "you can. Your brother Goro is chief of the House of Idé.”\n",
      "With that she bade them shut the door in his face.\n",
      "Fugiwaka departed sorrowfully, and at the cross-roads O Matsu, his\n",
      "nurse, met him. She had made herself ready for a journey: her robe was\n",
      "kilted, she had a staff in her hand and sandals on her feet.\n",
      "“My lord,” she said, “I am come to follow you to the world’s end.”\n",
      "Then Fugiwaka wept and laid his head upon the woman’s breast.\n",
      "“Ah,” he said, “my nurse, my nurse! And,” he said, “what of my father’s\n",
      "sword? I have lost the precious sword of Idé. The sword is my treasure,\n",
      "the sword is my trust, the sword is my fortune. I am bound to cherish\n",
      "it, to guard it, to keep it. But now I have lost it. Woe is me! I am\n",
      "undone, and so is all the House of Idé!”\n",
      "“Oh, say not so, my lord,” said O Matsu. “Here is gold; go you your way\n",
      "and I will return and guard the sword of Idé.”\n",
      "So Fugiwaka went his way with the gold that his nurse gave him.\n",
      "As for O Matsu, she went straightway and took the sword from its place\n",
      "where it lay with the household gods, and she buried it deep in the\n",
      "ground until such time as she might bear it in safety to her young\n",
      "lord.\n",
      "But soon the Lady Sadako became aware that the sacred sword was gone.\n",
      "“It is the nurse!” she cried. “The nurse has stolen it.... Some of you\n",
      "bring her to me.”\n",
      "Then the Lady Sadako’s people laid their hands roughly upon O Matsu and\n",
      "brought her before their mistress. But for all they could do O Matsu’s\n",
      "lips were sealed. She spoke never a word, neither could the Lady Sadako\n",
      "find out where the sword was. She pressed her thin lips together.\n",
      "“The woman is obstinate,” she said. “No matter; for such a fault I know\n",
      "the sovereign cure.”\n",
      "So she locked O Matsu in a dark dungeon and gave her neither food nor\n",
      "drink. Every day the Lady Sadako went to the door of the dark dungeon.\n",
      "“Well,” she said, “where is the sword of Idé? Will you say?”\n",
      "But O Matsu answered not a word.\n",
      "Howbeit she wept and sighed to herself in the darkness--“Alas! Alas!\n",
      "never alive may I come to my young lord. Yet he must have the sword of\n",
      "Idé, and I shall find a way.”\n",
      "Now after seven days the Lady Sadako sat in the garden-house to cool\n",
      "herself, for it was summer. The time was evening. Presently she saw a\n",
      "woman that came towards her through the garden flowers and trees. Frail\n",
      "and slender was the woman; as she came her body swayed and her slow\n",
      "steps faltered.\n",
      "“Why, this is strange!” said the Lady Sadako. “Here is O Matsu, that was\n",
      "locked in the dark dungeon.” And she sat still, watching.\n",
      "But O Matsu went to the place where she had buried the sword and\n",
      "scratched at the ground with her fingers. There she was, weeping and\n",
      "moaning and dragging at the earth. The stones cut her hands and they\n",
      "bled. Still she tore away the earth and found the sword at last. It was\n",
      "in its wrapping of gold and scarlet, and she clasped it to her bosom\n",
      "with a loud cry.\n",
      "“Woman, I have you now,” shrieked the Lady Sadako, “and the sword of Idé\n",
      "as well!” And she leaped from the garden-house and ran at full speed.\n",
      "She stretched forth her hand to catch O Matsu by the sleeve, but did not\n",
      "have her or the sword either, for both of them were gone in a flash, and\n",
      "the lady beat the empty air. Swiftly she sped to the dark dungeon, and\n",
      "as she went she called her people to bring torches. There lay the body\n",
      "of poor O Matsu, cold and dead upon the dungeon floor.\n",
      "“Send me the Wise Woman,” said the Lady Sadako.\n",
      "So they sent for the Wise Woman. And the Lady Sadako asked, “How long\n",
      "has she been dead?”\n",
      "The Wise Woman said, “She was starved to death; she has been dead two\n",
      "days. It were well you gave her fit burial; she was a good soul.”\n",
      "As for the sword of Idé, it was not found.\n",
      "Fugiwaka tossed to and fro upon his lowly bed in a wayside tavern. And\n",
      "it seemed to him that his nurse came to him and knelt by his side. Then\n",
      "he was soothed.\n",
      "O Matsu said, “Will you sleep now, my lord Fugiwaka?”\n",
      "And he answered, “I will sleep now, O Matsu.”\n",
      "“Listen, my lord,” she said, “and, sleeping or waking, remember. The\n",
      "sword is your treasure. The sword is your trust. The sword is your\n",
      "fortune. Cherish it, guard it, keep it.”\n",
      "The sword was in its wrapping of gold and scarlet, and she laid it by\n",
      "Fugiwaka’s side. The boy turned over to sleep, and his hand clasped the\n",
      "sword of Idé.\n",
      "“Waking or sleeping,” he said, “I will remember.”\n",

      "THE BEAUTIFUL DANCER OF YEDO\n",
      "[Illustration: The Beautiful Dancer of Yedo.--_P. 250._]\n",
      "This is the tale of Sakura-ko, Flower of the Cherry, who was the\n",
      "beautiful dancer of Yedo. She was a _geisha_, born a _samurai’s_\n",
      "daughter, that sold herself into bondage after her father died, so that\n",
      "her mother might have food to eat. Ah, the pity of it! The money that\n",
      "bought her was called _Namida no Kané_, that is “the money of tears.”\n",
      "She dwelt in the narrow street of the _geisha_, where the red and white\n",
      "lanterns swing and the plum trees flourish by the low eves. The street\n",
      "of the _geisha_ is full of music, for they play the _samisen_ there all\n",
      "day long.\n",
      "Sakura-ko played it too; indeed she was skilful in every lovely art. She\n",
      "played the _samisen_, the _kotto_, the _biwa_, and the small hand-drum.\n",
      "She could make songs and sing them. Her eyes were long, her hair was\n",
      "black, her hands were white. Her beauty was wonderful, and wonderful her\n",
      "power to please. From dawn to dusk, and from dusk to dawn she could go\n",
      "smiling and hide her heart. In the cool of the day she would stand\n",
      "upon the gallery of her mistress’s house, and muse as she stood and\n",
      "looked down into the street of the _geisha_. And the folk that passed\n",
      "that way said to one another, “See, yonder stands Sakura-ko, Flower of\n",
      "the Cherry, the beautiful dancer of Yedo, the _geisha_ without peer.”\n",
      "But Sakura-ko looked down and mused and said, “Little narrow street of\n",
      "the _geisha_, paved with bitterness and broken hearts, your houses are\n",
      "full of vain hopes and vain regrets; youth and love and grief dwell\n",
      "here. The flowers in your gardens are watered with tears.”\n",
      "The gentlemen of Yedo must needs have their pleasure, so Sakura-ko\n",
      "served at feasts every night. They whitened her cheeks and her forehead,\n",
      "and gilded her lips with _beni_. She wore silk attires, gold and purple\n",
      "and grey and green and black, _obi_ of brocade magnificently tied. Her\n",
      "hair was pinned with coral and jade, fastened with combs of gold lacquer\n",
      "and tortoise-shell. She poured _saké_, she made merry with the good\n",
      "company. More than this, she danced.\n",
      "Three poets sang of her dancing. One said, “She is lighter than the\n",
      "rainbow-tinted dragonfly.”\n",
      "And another said, “She moves like the mist of the morning when the\n",
      "bright sun shines.”\n",
      "And the third said, “She is like the shadow in the river of the waving\n",
      "willow-branch.”\n",
      "But it is time to tell of her three lovers.\n",
      "The first lover was neither old nor young. He was passing rich, and a\n",
      "great man in Yedo. He sent his servant to the street of the _geisha_\n",
      "with money in his girdle. Sakura-ko shut the door in his face.\n",
      "“You are wrong, fellow,” she said, “you have lost your way. You should\n",
      "have gone to the street of the toy-shops and bought your master a doll;\n",
      "let him know there are no dolls here.”\n",
      "After this the master came himself. “Come to me, O Flower of the\n",
      "Cherry,” he said, “for I must have you.”\n",
      "“_Must?_” she said, and looked down with her long eyes.\n",
      "“Aye,” he said, “must is the word, O Flower of the Cherry.”\n",
      "“What will you give me?” she said.\n",
      "“Fine attires, silk and brocade, a house, white mats and cool galleries;\n",
      "servants to wait on you, gold hairpins--what you will.”\n",
      "“What do I give you?” she said.\n",
      "“Yourself, just that, O Flower of the Cherry.”\n",
      "“Body and soul?” she said.\n",
      "And he answered her, “Body and soul.”\n",
      "“Now, fare you well,” she said, “I have a fancy to remain a _geisha_. It\n",
      "is a merry life,” she said, and she laughed.\n",
      "So that was the end of the first lover.\n",
      "The second lover was old. To be old and wise is very well, but he was\n",
      "old and foolish. “Sakura-ko,” he cried, “ah, cruel one, I am mad for\n",
      "love of you!”\n",
      "“My lord,” she said, “I can easily believe it.”\n",
      "He said, “I am not so very old.”\n",
      "“By the divine compassion of the gods,” she told him, “you may yet have\n",
      "time to prepare for your end. Go home and read the good law.” But the\n",
      "old lover would hear nothing of her counsel. Instead, he bade her to his\n",
      "house by night to a great feast which he had prepared for her. And when\n",
      "they had made an end of the feast she danced before him wearing scarlet\n",
      "_hakama_ and a robe of gold brocade. After the dancing he made her sit\n",
      "beside him and he called for wine, that they might drink together. And\n",
      "the _geisha_ who poured the _saké_ was called Silver Wave.\n",
      "When they had drunk together, Sakura-ko and her old lover, he drew her\n",
      "to him and cried:\n",
      "“Come, my love, my bride, you are mine for the time of many existences;\n",
      "there was poison in the cup. Be not afraid, for we shall die together.\n",
      "Come with me to the Meido.”\n",
      "But Sakura-ko said, “My sister, the Silver Wave, and I are not children,\n",
      "neither are we old and foolish to be deceived. I drank no _saké_ and no\n",
      "poison. My sister, the Silver Wave, poured fresh tea in my cup. Howbeit\n",
      "I am sorry for you, and so I will stay with you till you die.”\n",
      "He died in her arms and was fain to take his way alone to the Meido.\n",
      "“Alas! alas!” cried the Flower of the Cherry. But her sister, Silver\n",
      "Wave, gave her counsel thus: “Keep your tears, you will yet have cause\n",
      "for weeping. Waste not grief for such as he.”\n",
      "And that was the end of the second lover.\n",
      "The third lover was young and brave and gay. Impetuous he was, and\n",
      "beautiful. He first set eyes on the Flower of the Cherry at a festival\n",
      "in his father’s house. Afterwards he went to seek her out in the street\n",
      "of the _geisha_. He found her as she leaned against the gallery railing\n",
      "of her mistress’s house.\n",
      "She looked down into the street of the _geisha_ and sang this song:\n",
      "“My mother bade me spin fine thread\n",
      "Out of the yellow sea sand--\n",
      "A hard task, a hard task.\n",
      "May the dear gods speed me!\n",
      "My father gave me a basket of reeds;\n",
      "He said, ‘Draw water from the spring\n",
      "And carry it a mile’--\n",
      "A hard task, a hard task.\n",
      "May the dear gods speed me!\n",
      "My heart would remember,\n",
      "My heart must forget;\n",
      "Forget, my heart, forget--\n",
      "A hard task, a hard task.\n",
      "May the dear gods speed me!”\n",
      "When she had made an end of singing, the lover saw that her eyes were\n",
      "full of tears.\n",
      "“Do you remember me,” he said, “O Flower of the Cherry? I saw you last\n",
      "night at my father’s house.”\n",
      "“Aye, my young lord,” she answered him, “I remember you very well.”\n",
      "He said, “I am not so very young. And I love you, O Flower of the\n",
      "Cherry. Be gentle, hear me, be free, be my dear wife.”\n",
      "At this she flushed neck and chin, cheeks and forehead.\n",
      "“My dear,” said the young man, “now you are Flower of the Cherry\n",
      "indeed.”\n",
      "“Child,” she said, “go home and think of me no more. I am too old for\n",
      "such as you.”\n",
      "“Old!” he said; “why, there lies not a year between us!”\n",
      "“No, not a year--no year, but an eternity,” said Flower of the Cherry.\n",
      "“Think no more of me,” she said; but the lover thought of nothing else.\n",
      "His young blood was on fire. He could not eat, nor drink, nor sleep. He\n",
      "pined and grew pale, he wandered day and night, his heart heavy with\n",
      "longing. He lived in torment; weak he grew, and weaker. One night he\n",
      "fell fainting at the entrance of the street of the _geisha_. Sakura-ko\n",
      "came home at dawn from a festival in a great house. There she found him.\n",
      "She said no word, but she bore him to his house outside Yedo, and stayed\n",
      "with him there full three moons. And after that time he was nursed back\n",
      "to ruddy health. Swiftly, swiftly, the glad days sped by for both of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "“This is the happy time of all my life. I thank the dear gods,” said\n",
      "Flower of the Cherry one evening.\n",
      "“My dear,” the young man bade her, “fetch hither your _samisen_ and let\n",
      "me hear you sing.”\n",
      "So she did. She said, “I shall sing you a song you have heard already.”\n",
      "“My mother bade me spin fine thread\n",
      "Out of the yellow sea sand--\n",
      "A hard task, a hard task.\n",
      "May the dear gods speed me!\n",
      "My father gave me a basket of reeds;\n",
      "He said, ‘Draw water from the spring\n",
      "And carry it a mile’--\n",
      "A hard task, a hard task.\n",
      "May the dear gods speed me!\n",
      "My heart would remember,\n",
      "My heart must forget;\n",
      "Forget, my heart, forget--\n",
      "A hard task, a hard task.\n",
      "May the dear gods speed me!”\n",
      "“Sweet,” he said, “what does this song mean, and why do you sing it?”\n",
      "She answered, “My lord, it means that I must leave you, and therefore do\n",
      "I sing it. I must forget you; you must forget me. That is my desire.”\n",
      "He said, “I will never forget you, not in a thousand existences.”\n",
      "She smiled, “Pray the gods you may wed a sweet wife and have children.”\n",
      "He cried, “No wife but you, and no children but yours, O Flower of the\n",
      "Cherry.”\n",
      "“The gods forbid, my dear, my dear. All the world lies between us.”\n",

      "lamenting and seeking her both near and far. It was all in vain, for he\n",
      "found her not. The city of Yedo knew her no more--Sakura-ko, the\n",

      "So he did as he would.\n",
      "As he filled the begging bowl and patted down the rice with a wooden\n",
      "spoon and laughed, the nun caught him by the sleeve and held him and\n",

      "“Holy nun, why do you look at me so?” cried the child.\n",
      "She said, “Because I once had a little boy like you, and I went away and\n",
      "left him.”\n",
      "“Poor little boy!” said the child.\n",

      "Desired, the Fairest of the Fair.\n",
      "It is true that eighty men of name came to seek her hand. Princes they\n",

      "far. Across the Sea Path they came in great ships, white sails or\n",
      "creaking oars, with brave and lusty sailors. Through the forests dark\n",
      "and dangerous they made their way to the Princess, the Greatly Desired;\n",
      "or lightly, lightly they descended by way of the Floating Bridge in\n",

      "They brought minstrels and singers and dancers and tellers of tales to\n",
      "entertain the Princess, the Greatly Desired.\n",
      "As for the Princess, she sat still in her white bower with her maidens\n",

      "spread it afresh over the mats, set out her deep sleeves, or combed her\n",
      "long hair with a golden comb.\n",
      "Round about the bower was a gallery of white wood, and here the suitors\n",
      "came and knelt in the presence of their liege lady.\n",
      "Many and many a time the carp leapt in the garden fish-pond. Many and\n",
      "many a time a scarlet pomegranate flower fluttered and dropped from the\n",
      "tree. Many and many a time the lady shook her head and a lover went his\n",
      "way, sad and sorry.\n",
      "Now it happened that the God of Autumn went to try his fortune with the\n",
      "Princess. He was a brave young man indeed. Ardent were his eyes; the\n",
      "colour flamed in his dark cheek. He was girded with a sword that ten men\n",
      "could not lift. The chrysanthemums of autumn burned upon his coat in\n",
      "cunning broidery. He came and bent his proud head to the very ground\n",
      "before the Princess, then raised it and looked her full in the eyes. She\n",
      "opened her sweet red lips--waited--said nothing--but shook her head.\n",
      "So the God of Autumn went forth from her presence, blinded with his\n",
      "bitter tears.\n",
      "He found his younger brother, the God of Spring.\n",
      "“How fares it with you, my brother?” said the God of Spring.\n",
      "“Ill, ill indeed, for she will not have me. She is the proud lady. Mine\n",
      "is the broken heart.”\n",
      "“Ah, my brother!” said the God of Spring.\n",
      "“You’d best come home with me, for all is over with us,” said the God of\n",
      "Autumn.\n",
      "But the God of Spring said, “I stay here.”\n",
      "“What,” cried his brother, “is it likely, then, that she will take you\n",
      "if she’ll have none of me? Will she love the smooth cheeks of a child\n",
      "and flout the man full grown? Will you go to her, brother? She’ll laugh\n",
      "at you for your pains.”\n",
      "“Still I will go,” said the God of Spring.\n",
      "“A wager! A wager!” the God of Autumn cried. “I’ll give you a cask of\n",
      "_saké_ if you win her--_saké_ for the merry feast of your wedding. If\n",
      "you lose her, the _saké_ will be for me. I’ll drown my grief in it.”\n",
      "“Well, brother,” said the God of Spring, “I take the wager. You’ll have\n",
      "your _saké_ like enough indeed.”\n",
      "“And so I think,” said the God of Autumn, and went his ways.\n",
      "Then the young God of Spring went to his mother, who loved him.\n",
      "“Do you love me, my mother?” he said.\n",
      "She answered, “More than a hundred existences.”\n",
      "“Mother,” he said, “get me for my wife the Princess, the Fairest of the\n",
      "Fair. She is called the Greatly Desired; greatly, oh, greatly, do I\n",
      "desire her.”\n",
      "“You love her, my son?” said his mother.\n",
      "“More than a hundred existences,” he said.\n",
      "“Then lie down, my son, my best beloved, lie down and sleep, and I will\n",
      "work for you.”\n",
      "So she spread a couch for him, and when he was asleep she looked on him.\n",
      "“Your face,” she said, “is the sweetest thing in the world.”\n",
      "There was no sleep for her the live-long night, but she went swiftly to\n",
      "a place she knew of, where the wistaria drooped over a still pool. She\n",
      "plucked her sprays and tendrils and brought home as much as she could\n",
      "carry. The wistaria was white and purple, and you must know it was not\n",
      "yet in flower, but hidden in the unopened bud. From it she wove\n",
      "magically a robe. She fashioned sandals also, and a bow and arrows.\n",
      "In the morning she waked the God of Spring.\n",
      "“Come, my son,” she said, “let me put this robe on you.”\n",
      "The God of Spring rubbed his eyes. “A sober suit for courting,” he said.\n",
      "But he did as his mother bade him. And he bound the sandals on his feet,\n",
      "and slung the bow and the arrows in their quiver on his back.\n",
      "“Will all be well, my mother?” he said.\n",
      "“All will be well, beloved,” she answered him.\n",
      "So the God of Spring came before the Fairest of the Fair. And one of her\n",
      "maidens laughed and said:\n",
      "“See, mistress, there comes to woo you to-day only a little plain boy,\n",
      "all in sober grey.”\n",
      "But the Fairest of the Fair lifted up her eyes and looked upon the God\n",
      "of Spring. And in the same moment the wistaria with which he was clothed\n",
      "burst into flower. He was sweet-scented, white and purple from head to\n",
      "heel.\n",
      "The Princess rose from the white mats.\n",
      "“Lord,” she said, “I am yours if you will have me.”\n",
      "Hand in hand they went together to the mother of the God of Spring.\n",
      "“Ah, my mother,” he said, “what shall I do now? My brother the God of\n",
      "Autumn is angry with me. He will not give me the _saké_ I have won from\n",
      "him in a wager. Great is his rage. He will seek to take our lives.”\n",
      "“Be still, beloved,” said his mother, “and fear not.”\n",
      "She took a cane of hollow bamboo, and in the hollow she put salt and\n",
      "stones; and when she had wrapped the cane round with leaves, she hung it\n",
      "in the smoke of the fire. She said:\n",
      "“The green leaves fade and die. So you must do, my eldest born, the God\n",
      "of Autumn. The stone sinks in the sea, so must you sink. You must sink,\n",
      "you must fail, like the ebb tide.”\n",
      "Now the tale is told, and all the world knows why Spring is fresh and\n",
      "merry and young, and Autumn the saddest thing that is.\n",

      "THE STRANGE STORY OF THE GOLDEN COMB\n",
      "[Illustration: The Strange Story of the Golden Comb.--_P. 191._]\n",
      "In ancient days two _samurai_ dwelt in Sendai of the North. They were\n",
      "friends and brothers in arms.\n",
      "Hasunuma one was named, and the other Saito. Now it happened that a\n",
      "daughter was born to the house of Hasunuma, and upon the selfsame day,\n",
      "and in the selfsame hour, there was born to the house of Saito a son.\n",
      "The boy child they called Konojo, and the girl they called Aiko, which\n",
      "means the Child of Love.\n",
      "Or ever a year had passed over their innocent heads the children were\n",
      "betrothed to one another. And as a token the wife of Saito gave a golden\n",
      "comb to the wife of Hasunuma, saying: “For the child’s hair when she\n",
      "shall be old enough.” Aiko’s mother wrapped the comb in a handkerchief,\n",
      "and laid it away in her chest. It was of gold lacquer, very fine work,\n",
      "adorned with golden dragon-flies.\n",
      "This was very well; but before long misfortune came upon Saito and his\n",
      "house, for, by sad mischance, he aroused the ire of his feudal lord, and\n",
      "he was fain to fly from Sendai by night, and his wife was with him, and\n",
      "the child. No man knew where they went, or had any news of them, nor of\n",
      "how they fared, and for long, long years Hasunuma heard not one word of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "The child Aiko grew to be the loveliest lady in Sendai. She had longer\n",
      "hair than any maiden in the city, and she was the most graceful dancer\n",
      "ever seen. She moved as a wave of the sea, or a cloud of the sky, or the\n",
      "wild bamboo grass in the wind. She had a sister eleven moons younger\n",
      "than she, who was called Aiyamé, or the Water Iris; and she was the\n",
      "second loveliest lady in Sendai. Aiko was white, but Aiyamé was brown,\n",
      "quick, and light, and laughing. When they went abroad in the streets of\n",
      "Sendai, folk said, “There go the moon and the south wind.”\n",
      "Upon an idle summer day when all the air was languid, and the cicala\n",
      "sang ceaselessly as he swung on the pomegranate bough, the maidens\n",
      "rested on the cool white mats of their lady mother’s bower. Their dark\n",
      "locks were loose, and their slender feet were bare. They had between\n",
      "them an ancient chest of red lacquer, a Bride Box of their lady\n",
      "mother’s, and in the chest they searched and rummaged for treasure.\n",
      "“See, sister,” said Aiyamé, “here are scarlet thongs, the very thing for\n",
      "my sandals ... and what is this? A crystal rosary, I declare! How\n",
      "beautiful!”\n",
      "Aiko said, “My mother, I pray you give me this length of violet silk, it\n",
      "will make me very fine undersleeves to my new grey gown; and, mother,\n",
      "let me have the crimson for a petticoat; and surely, mother, you do not\n",
      "need this little bit of brocade?”\n",
      "“And what an _obi_,” cried Aiyamé, as she dragged it from the chest,\n",
      "“grass green and silver!” Springing lightly up, she wound the length\n",
      "about her slender body. “Now behold me for the finest lady in all\n",
      "Sendai. Very envious shall be the daughter of the rich Hachiman, when\n",
      "she sees this wonder _obi_; but I shall be calm and careless, and say,\n",
      "looking down thus humbly, ‘Your pardon, noble lady, that I wear this\n",
      "foolish trifling _obi_, unmeet for your great presence!’ Mother, mother,\n",
      "give me the _obi_.”\n",
      "“Arah! Arah! Little pirates!” said the mother, and smiled.\n",
      "Aiko thrust her hand to the bottom of the chest. “Here is something\n",
      "hard,” she murmured, “a little casket wrapped in a silken handkerchief.\n",
      "How it smells of orris and ancient spices!--now what may it be?” So\n",
      "saying, she unwound the kerchief and opened the casket. “A golden comb!”\n",
      "she said, and laid it on her knee.\n",
      "“Give it here, child,” cried the mother quickly; “it is not for your\n",
      "eyes.”\n",
      "But the maiden sat quite still, her eyes upon the golden comb. It was of\n",
      "gold lacquer, very fine work, adorned with golden dragon-flies.\n",
      "For a time the maiden said not a word, nor did her mother, though she\n",
      "was troubled; and even the light Lady of the South Wind seemed stricken\n",
      "into silence, and drew the scarlet sandal thongs through and through\n",
      "her fingers.\n",
      "“Mother, what of this golden comb?” said Aiko at last.\n",
      "“My sweet, it is the love-token between you and Konojo, the son of\n",
      "Saito, for you two were betrothed in your cradles. But now it is full\n",
      "fifteen years since Saito went from Sendai in the night, he and all his\n",
      "house, and left no trace behind.”\n",
      "“Is my love dead?” said Aiko.\n",
      "“Nay, that I know not--but he will never come; so, I beseech you, think\n",
      "no more of him, my pretty bird. There, get you your fan, and dance for\n",
      "me and for your sister.”\n",
      "Aiko first set the golden comb in her hair. Then she flung open her fan\n",
      "to dance. She moved like a wave of the sea, or a cloud of the sky, or\n",
      "the wild bamboo grass in the wind. She had not danced long before she\n",
      "dropped the fan, with a long cry, and she herself fell her length upon\n",
      "the ground. From that hour she was in a piteous way, and lay in her bed\n",
      "sighing, like a maid lovelorn and forsaken. She could not eat nor sleep;\n",
      "she had no pleasure in life. The sunrise and the sound of rain at night\n",
      "were nothing to her any more. Not her father, nor her mother, nor her\n",
      "sister, the Lady of the South Wind, were able to give her any ease.\n",
      "Presently she turned her face to the wall. “It is more than I can\n",
      "understand,” she said, and so died.\n",
      "When they had prepared the poor young maid for her grave, her mother\n",
      "came, crying, to look at her for the last time. And she set the golden\n",
      "comb in the maid’s hair, saying:\n",
      "“My own dear little child, I pray that in other lives you may know\n",
      "happiness. Therefore take your golden token with you; you will have need\n",
      "of it when you meet the wraith of your lover.” For she believed that\n",
      "Konojo was dead.\n",
      "But, alas, for Karma that is so pitiless, one short moon had the maid\n",
      "been in her grave when the brave young man, her betrothed, came to claim\n",
      "her at her father’s house.\n",
      "“Alas and alack, Konojo, the son of Saito, alas, my brave young man, too\n",
      "late you have come! Your joy is turned to mourning, for your bride lies\n",
      "under the green grass, and her sister goes weeping in the moonlight to\n",
      "pour the water of the dead.” Thus spoke Hasunuma the _samurai_.\n",
      "“Lord,” said the brave young man, “there are three ways left, the sword,\n",
      "the strong girdle, and the river. These are the short roads to Yomi.\n",
      "Farewell.”\n",
      "But Hasunuma held the young man by the arm. “Nay, then, thou son of\n",
      "Saito,” he said, “but hear the fourth way, which is far better. The road\n",
      "to Yomi is short, but it is very dark; moreover, from the confines of\n",
      "that country few return. Therefore stay with me, Konojo, and comfort me\n",
      "in my old age, for I have no sons.”\n",
      "So Konojo entered the household of Hasunuma the _samurai_, and dwelt in\n",
      "the garden house by the gate.\n",
      "Now in the third month Hasunuma and his wife and the daughter that was\n",
      "left them arose early and dressed them in garments of ceremony, and\n",
      "presently were borne away in _kago_, for to the temple they were bound,\n",
      "and to their ancestral tombs, where they offered prayers and incense the\n",
      "live-long day.\n",
      "It was bright starlight when they returned, and cold the night was,\n",
      "still and frosty. Konojo stood and waited at the garden gate. He waited\n",
      "for their home-coming, as was meet. He drew his cloak about him and gave\n",
      "ear to the noises of the evening. He heard the sound of the blind man’s\n",
      "whistle, and the blind man’s staff upon the stones. Far off he heard a\n",
      "child laugh twice; then he heard men singing in chorus, as men who sing\n",
      "to cheer themselves in their labour, and in the pauses of song he heard\n",
      "the creak, creak of swinging _kago_ that the men bore upon their\n",
      "shoulders, and he said, “They come.”\n",
      "“I go to the house of the Beloved,\n",
      "Her plum tree stands by the eaves;\n",
      "It is full of blossom.\n",
      "The dew lies in the heart of the flowers,\n",
      "So they are the drinking-cups of the sparrows.\n",
      "How do you go to your love’s house?\n",
      "Even upon the wings of the night wind.\n",
      "Which road leads to your love’s house?\n",
      "All the roads in the world.”\n",
      "This was the song of the _kago_ men. First the _kago_ of Hasunuma the\n",
      "_samurai_ turned in at the garden gate, then followed his lady; last\n",
      "came Aiyamé of the South Wind. Upon the roof of her _kago_ there lay a\n",
      "blossoming bough.\n",
      "“Rest well, lady,” said Konojo, as she passed, and had no answer back.\n",
      "Howbeit it seemed that some light thing dropped from the _kago_, and\n",
      "fell with a little noise to the ground. He stooped and picked up a\n",
      "woman’s comb. It was of gold lacquer, very fine work, adorned with\n",
      "golden dragon-flies. Smooth and warm it lay in the hand of Konojo. And\n",
      "he went his way to the garden house. At the hour of the rat the young\n",
      "_samurai_ threw down his book of verse, laid himself upon his bed, and\n",
      "blew out his light. And the selfsame moment he heard a wandering step\n",
      "without.\n",
      "“And who may it be that visits the garden house by night?” said Konojo,\n",
      "and he wondered. About and about went the wandering feet till at length\n",
      "they stayed, and the door was touched with an uncertain hand.\n",
      "“Konojo! Konojo!”\n",
      "“What is it?” said the _samurai_.\n",
      "“Open, open; I am afraid.”\n",
      "“Who are you, and why are you afraid?”\n",
      "“I am afraid of the night. I am the daughter of Hasunuma the\n",
      "_samurai_.... Open to me for the love of the gods.”\n",
      "Konojo undid the latch and slid back the door of the garden house to\n",
      "find a slender and drooping lady upon the threshold. He could not see\n",
      "her face, for she held her long sleeve so as to hide it from him; but\n",
      "she swayed and trembled, and her frail shoulders shook with sobbing.\n",
      "“Let me in,” she moaned, and forthwith entered the garden house.\n",
      "Half smiling and much perplexed, Konojo asked her:\n",
      "“Are you Aiyamé, whom they call the Lady of the South Wind?”\n",
      "“I am she.”\n",
      "“Lady, you do me much honour.”\n",
      "“The comb!” she said, “the golden comb!”\n",
      "As she said this, she threw the veil from her face, and taking the robe\n",
      "of Konojo in both her little hands, she looked into his eyes as though\n",
      "she would draw forth his very soul. The lady was brown and quick and\n",
      "light. Her eyes and her lips were made for laughing, and passing strange\n",
      "she looked in the guise that she wore then.\n",
      "“The comb!” she said, “the golden comb!”\n",
      "“I have it here,” said Konojo; “only let go my robe, and I will fetch it\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "At this the lady cast herself down upon the white mats in a passion of\n",
      "bitter tears, and Konojo, poor unfortunate, pressed his hands together,\n",
      "quite beside himself.\n",
      "“What to do?” he said; “what to do?”\n",
      "At last he raised the lady in his arms, and stroked her little hand to\n",
      "comfort her.\n",
      "“Lord,” she said, as simply as a child, “lord, do you love me?”\n",
      "And he answered her in a moment, “I love you more than many lives, O\n",
      "Lady of the South Wind.”\n",
      "“Lord,” she said, “will you come with me then?”\n",
      "He answered her, “Even to the land of Yomi,” and took her hand.\n",
      "Forth they went into the night, and they took the road together. By\n",
      "river-side they went, and over plains of flowers; they went by rocky\n",
      "ways, or through the whispering pines, and when they had wandered far\n",
      "enough, of the green bamboos they built them a little house to dwell in.\n",
      "And they were there for a year of happy days and nights.\n",
      "Now upon a morning of the third month Konojo beheld men with _kago_ come\n",
      "swinging through the bamboo grove. And he said:\n",
      "“What have they to do with us, these men and their _kago_?”\n",
      "“Lord,” said Aiyamé, “they come to bear us to my father’s house.”\n",
      "He cried, “What is this foolishness? We will not go.”\n",
      "“Indeed, and we must go,” said the lady.\n",
      "“Go you, then,” said Konojo; “as for me, I stay here where I am happy.”\n",
      "“Ah, lord,” she said, “ah, my dear, do you then love me less, who vowed\n",
      "to go with me, even to the Land of Yomi?”\n",
      "Then he did all that she would. And he broke a blossoming bough from a\n",
      "tree that grew near by and laid it upon the roof of her _kago_.\n",
      "Swiftly, swiftly they were borne, and the _kago_ men sang as they went,\n",
      "a song to make labour light.\n",
      "“I go to the house of the Beloved,\n",
      "Her plum tree stands by the eaves;\n",
      "It is full of blossom.\n",
      "The dew lies in the heart of the flowers,\n",
      "So they are the drinking-cups of the sparrows.\n",
      "How do you go to your love’s house?\n",
      "Even upon the wings of the night wind.\n",
      "Which road leads to your love’s house?\n",
      "All the roads in the world.”\n",
      "This was the song of the _kago_ men.\n",
      "About nightfall they came to the house of Hasunuma the _samurai_.\n",
      "“Go you in, my dear lord,” said the Lady of the South Wind. “I will wait\n",
      "without; if my father is very wroth with you, only show him the golden\n",
      "comb.” And with that she took it from her hair and gave it him. Smooth\n",
      "and warm it lay in his hand. Then Konojo went into the house.\n",
      "“Welcome, welcome home, Konojo, son of Saito!” cried Hasunuma. “How has\n",
      "it fared with your knightly adventure?”\n",
      "“Knightly adventure!” said Konojo, and blushed.\n",
      "“It is a year since your sudden departure, and we supposed that you had\n",
      "gone upon a quest, or in the expiation of some vow laid upon your soul.”\n",
      "“Alas, my good lord,” said Konojo, “I have sinned against you and\n",
      "against your house.” And he told Hasunuma what he had done.\n",
      "When he had made an end of his tale:\n",
      "“Boy,” said the _samurai_, “you jest, but your merry jest is ill-timed.\n",
      "Know that my child lies even as one dead. For a year she has neither\n",
      "risen nor spoken nor smiled. She is visited by a heavy sickness and none\n",
      "can heal her.”\n",
      "“Sir,” said Konojo, “your child, the Lady of the South Wind, waits in a\n",
      "_kago_ without your garden wall. I will fetch her in presently.”\n",
      "Forth they went together, the young man and the _samurai_, but they\n",
      "found no _kago_ without the garden wall, no _kago_-bearers and no lady.\n",
      "Only a broken bough of withered blossom lay upon the ground.\n",
      "“Indeed, indeed, she was here but now!” cried Konojo. “She gave me her\n",
      "comb--her golden comb. See, my lord, here it is.”\n",
      "“What comb is this, Konojo? Where got you this comb that was set in a\n",
      "dead maid’s hair, and buried with her beneath the green grass? Where got\n",
      "you the comb of Aiko, the Lady of the Moon, that died for love? Speak,\n",
      "Konojo, son of Saito. This is a strange thing.”\n",
      "Now whilst Konojo stood amazed, and leaned silent and bewildered against\n",
      "the garden wall, a lady came lightly through the trees. She moved as a\n",
      "wave of the sea, or a cloud of the sky, or the wild bamboo grass in the\n",
      "wind.\n",
      "“Aiyamé,” cried the _samurai_, “how are you able to leave your bed?”\n",
      "The young man said nothing, but fell on his knees beside the garden\n",
      "wall. There the lady came to him and bent so that her hair and her\n",
      "garments overshadowed him, and her eyes held his.\n",
      "“Lord,” she said, “I am the spirit of Aiko your love. I went with a\n",
      "broken heart to dwell with the shades of Yomi. The very dead took pity\n",
      "on my tears. I was permitted to return, and for one short year to\n",
      "inhabit the sweet body of my sister. And now my time is come. I go my\n",
      "ways to the grey country. I shall be the happiest soul in Yomi--I have\n",
      "known you, beloved. Now take me in your arms, for I grow very faint.”\n",
      "With that she sank to the ground, and Konojo put his arms about her and\n",
      "laid her head against his heart. His tears fell upon her forehead.\n",
      "“Promise me,” she said, “that you will take to wife Aiyamé, my sister,\n",
      "the Lady of the South Wind.”\n",
      "“Ah,” he cried, “my lady and my love!”\n",
      "“Promise, promise,” she said.\n",
      "Then he promised.\n",
      "After a little she stirred in his arms.\n",
      "“What is it?” he said.\n",
      "So soft her voice that it did not break the silence but floated upon it.\n",
      "“The comb,” she murmured, “the golden comb.”\n",
      "And Konojo set it in her hair.\n",
      "*       *       *       *       *\n",
      "A burden, pale but breathing, Konojo carried into the house of Hasunuma\n",
      "and laid upon the white mats and silken cushions. And after three hours\n",
      "a young maid sat up and rubbed her sleepy eyes. She was brown and quick\n",
      "and light and laughing. Her hair was tumbled about her rosy cheeks,\n",
      "unconfined by any braid or comb. She stared first at her father, and\n",
      "then at the young man that was in her bower. She smiled, then flushed,\n",
      "and put her little hands before her face.\n",
      "“Greeting, O Lady of the South Wind,” said Konojo.\n",

      "Long ago, as I’ve heard tell, there dwelt at the temple of Morinji, in\n",
      "the Province of Kotsuke, a holy priest.\n",
      "Now there were three things about this reverend man. First, he was\n",
      "wrapped up in meditations and observances and forms and doctrines. He\n",
      "was a great one for the Sacred Sutras, and knew strange and mystical\n",
      "things. Then he had a fine exquisite taste of his own, and nothing\n",
      "pleased him so much as the ancient tea ceremony of the _Cha-no-yu_; and\n",
      "for the third thing about him, he knew both sides of a copper coin well\n",
      "enough and loved a bargain.\n",
      "None so pleased as he when he happened upon an ancient tea-kettle, lying\n",
      "rusty and dirty and half-forgotten in a corner of a poor shop in a back\n",
      "street of his town.\n",
      "“An ugly bit of old metal,” says the holy man to the shopkeeper; “but it\n",
      "will do well enough to boil my humble drop of water of an evening. I’ll\n",
      "give you three _rin_ for it.” This he did and took the kettle home,\n",
      "rejoicing; for it was of bronze, fine work, the very thing for the\n",
      "_Cha-no-yu_.\n",
      "A novice cleaned and scoured the tea-kettle, and it came out as pretty\n",
      "as you please. The priest turned it this way and that, and upside down,\n",
      "looked into it, tapped it with his finger-nail. He smiled. “A bargain,”\n",
      "he cried, “a bargain!” and rubbed his hands. He set the kettle upon a\n",
      "box covered over with a purple cloth, and looked at it so long that\n",
      "first he was fain to rub his eyes many times, and then to close them\n",
      "altogether. His head dropped forward and he slept.\n",
      "And then, believe me, the wonderful thing happened. The tea-kettle\n",
      "moved, though no hand was near it. A hairy head, with two bright eyes,\n",
      "looked out of the spout. The lid jumped up and down. Four brown and\n",
      "hairy paws appeared, and a fine bushy tail. In a minute the kettle was\n",
      "down from the box and going round and round looking at things.\n",
      "“A very comfortable room, to be sure,” says the tea-kettle.\n",
      "Pleased enough to find itself so well lodged, it soon began to dance and\n",
      "to caper nimbly and to sing at the top of its voice. Three or four\n",
      "novices were studying in the next room. “The old man is lively,” they\n",
      "said; “only hark to him. What can he be at?” And they laughed in their\n",
      "sleeves.\n",
      "Heaven’s mercy, the noise that the tea-kettle made! Bang! bang! Thud!\n",
      "thud! thud!\n",
      "The novices soon stopped laughing. One of them slid aside the\n",
      "_kara-kami_ and peeped through.\n",
      "“Arah, the devil and all’s in it!” he cried. “Here’s the master’s old\n",
      "tea-kettle turned into a sort of a badger. The gods protect us from\n",
      "witchcraft, or for certain we shall be lost!”\n",
      "“And I scoured it not an hour since,” said another novice, and he fell\n",
      "to reciting the Holy Sutras on his knees.\n",
      "A third laughed. “I’m for a nearer view of the hobgoblin,” he said.\n",
      "So the lot of them left their books in a twinkling, and gave chase to\n",
      "the tea-kettle to catch it. But could they come up with the tea-kettle?\n",
      "Not a bit of it. It danced and it leapt and it flew up into the air. The\n",
      "novices rushed here and there, slipping upon the mats. They grew hot.\n",
      "They grew breathless.\n",
      "“Ha, ha! Ha, ha!” laughed the tea-kettle; and “Catch me if you can!”\n",
      "laughed the wonderful tea-kettle.\n",
      "Presently the priest awoke, all rosy, the holy man.\n",
      "“And what’s the meaning of this racket,” he says, “disturbing me at my\n",
      "holy meditations and all?”\n",
      "“Master, master,” cry the novices, panting and mopping their brows,\n",
      "“your tea-kettle is bewitched. It was a badger, no less. And the dance\n",
      "it has been giving us, you’d never believe!”\n",
      "“Stuff and nonsense,” says the priest; “bewitched? Not a bit of it.\n",
      "There it rests on its box, good quiet thing, just where I put it.”\n",
      "Sure enough, so it did, looking as hard and cold and innocent as you\n",
      "please. There was not a hair of a badger near it. It was the novices\n",
      "that looked foolish.\n",
      "“A likely story indeed,” says the priest. “I have heard of the pestle\n",
      "that took wings to itself and flew away, parting company with the\n",
      "mortar. That is easily to be understood by any man. But a kettle that\n",
      "turned into a badger--no, no! To your books, my sons, and pray to be\n",
      "preserved from the perils of illusion.”\n",
      "That very night the holy man filled the kettle with water from the\n",
      "spring and set it on the _hibachi_ to boil for his cup of tea. When the\n",
      "water began to boil--\n",
      "“Ai! Ai!” the kettle cried; “Ai! Ai! The heat of the Great Hell!” And it\n",
      "lost no time at all, but hopped off the fire as quick as you please.\n",
      "“Sorcery!” cried the priest. “Black magic! A devil! A devil! A devil!\n",
      "Mercy on me! Help! Help! Help!” He was frightened out of his wits, the\n",
      "dear good man. All the novices came running to see what was the matter.\n",
      "“The tea-kettle is bewitched,” he gasped; “it was a badger, assuredly it\n",
      "was a badger ... it both speaks and leaps about the room.”\n",
      "“Nay, master,” said a novice, “see where it rests upon its box, good\n",
      "quiet thing.”\n",
      "And sure enough, so it did.\n",
      "“Most reverend sir,” said the novice, “let us all pray to be preserved\n",
      "from the perils of illusion.”\n",
      "The priest sold the tea-kettle to a tinker and got for it twenty copper\n",
      "coins.\n",
      "“It’s a mighty fine bit of bronze,” says the priest. “Mind, I’m giving\n",
      "it away to you, I’m sure I cannot tell what for.” Ah, he was the one for\n",
      "a bargain! The tinker was a happy man and carried home the kettle. He\n",
      "turned it this way and that, and upside down, and looked into it.\n",
      "“A pretty piece,” says the tinker; “a very good bargain.” And when he\n",
      "went to bed that night he put the kettle by him, to see it first thing\n",
      "in the morning.\n",
      "He awoke at midnight and fell to looking at the kettle by the bright\n",
      "light of the moon.\n",
      "Presently it moved, though there was no hand near it.\n",
      "“Strange,” said the tinker; but he was a man who took things as they\n",
      "came.\n",
      "A hairy head, with two bright eyes, looked out of the kettle’s spout.\n",
      "The lid jumped up and down. Four brown and hairy paws appeared, and a\n",
      "fine bushy tail. It came quite close to the tinker and laid a paw upon\n",
      "him.\n",
      "“Well?” says the tinker.\n",
      "“I am not wicked,” says the tea-kettle.\n",
      "“No,” says the tinker.\n",
      "“But I like to be well treated. I am a badger tea-kettle.”\n",
      "“So it seems,” says the tinker.\n",
      "“At the temple they called me names, and beat me and set me on the fire.\n",
      "I couldn’t stand it, you know.”\n",
      "“I like your spirit,” says the tinker.\n",
      "“I think I shall settle down with you.”\n",
      "“Shall I keep you in a lacquer box?” says the tinker.\n",
      "“Not a bit of it, keep me with you; let us have a talk now and again. I\n",
      "am very fond of a pipe. I like rice to eat, and beans and sweet things.”\n",
      "“A cup of _saké_ sometimes?” says the tinker.\n",
      "“Well, yes, now you mention it.”\n",
      "“I’m willing,” says the tinker.\n",
      "“Thank you kindly,” says the tea-kettle; “and, as a beginning, would you\n",
      "object to my sharing your bed? The night has turned a little chilly.”\n",
      "“Not the least in the world,” says the tinker.\n",
      "The tinker and the tea-kettle became the best of friends. They ate and\n",
      "talked together. The kettle knew a thing or two and was very good\n",
      "company.\n",
      "One day: “Are you poor?” says the kettle.\n",
      "“Yes,” says the tinker, “middling poor.”\n",
      "“Well, I have a happy thought. For a tea-kettle, I am\n",
      "out-of-the-way--really very accomplished.”\n",
      "“I believe you,” says the tinker.\n",
      "“My name is _Bumbuku-Chagama_; I am the very prince of Badger\n",
      "Tea-Kettles.”\n",
      "“Your servant, my lord,” says the tinker.\n",
      "“If you’ll take my advice,” says the tea-kettle, “you’ll carry me round\n",
      "as a show; I really am out-of-the-way, and it’s my opinion you’d make a\n",
      "mint of money.”\n",
      "“That would be hard work for you, my dear _Bumbuku_,” says the tinker.\n",
      "“Not at all; let us start forthwith,” says the tea-kettle.\n",
      "So they did. The tinker bought hangings for a theatre, and he called the\n",
      "show _Bumbuku-Chagama_. How the people flocked to see the fun! For the\n",
      "wonderful and most accomplished tea-kettle danced and sang, and walked\n",
      "the tight rope as to the manner born. It played such tricks and had such\n",
      "droll ways that the people laughed till their sides ached. It was a\n",
      "treat to see the tea-kettle bow as gracefully as a lord and thank the\n",
      "people for their patience.\n",
      "The _Bumbuku-Chagama_ was the talk of the country-side, and all the\n",
      "gentry came to see it as well as the commonalty. As for the tinker, he\n",
      "waved a fan and took the money. You may believe that he grew fat and\n",
      "rich. He even went to Court, where the great ladies and the royal\n",
      "princesses made much of the wonderful tea-kettle.\n",
      "At last the tinker retired from business, and to him the tea-kettle came\n",
      "with tears in its bright eyes.\n",
      "“I’m much afraid it’s time to leave you,” it says.\n",
      "“Now, don’t say that, _Bumbuku_, dear,” says the tinker. “We’ll be so\n",
      "happy together now we are rich.”\n",
      "“I’ve come to the end of my time,” says the tea-kettle. “You’ll not see\n",
      "old _Bumbuku_ any more; henceforth I shall be an ordinary kettle,\n",
      "nothing more or less.”\n",
      "“Oh, my dear _Bumbuku_, what shall I do?” cried the poor tinker in\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "“I think I should like to be given to the temple of Morinji, as a very\n",
      "sacred treasure,” says the tea-kettle.\n",
      "It never spoke or moved again. So the tinker presented it as a very\n",
      "sacred treasure to the temple, and the half of his wealth with it.\n",
      "And the tea-kettle was held in wondrous fame for many a long year. Some\n",
      "persons even worshipped it as a saint.\n",
      "IV\n",
      "THE PEONY LANTERN\n",
      "[Illustration: The Peony Lantern.--_P. 25._]\n",
      "In Yedo there dwelt a _samurai_ called Hagiwara. He was a _samurai_ of\n",
      "the _hatamoto_, which is of all the ranks of _samurai_ the most\n",
      "honourable. He possessed a noble figure and a very beautiful face, and\n",
      "was beloved of many a lady of Yedo, both openly and in secret. For\n",
      "himself, being yet very young, his thoughts turned to pleasure rather\n",
      "than to love, and morning, noon and night he was wont to disport himself\n",
      "with the gay youth of the city. He was the prince and leader of joyous\n",
      "revels within doors and without, and would often parade the streets for\n",
      "long together with bands of his boon companions.\n",
      "One bright and wintry day during the Festival of the New Year he found\n",
      "himself with a company of laughing youths and maidens playing at\n",
      "battledore and shuttlecock. He had wandered far away from his own\n",
      "quarter of the city, and was now in a suburb quite the other side of\n",
      "Yedo, where the streets were empty, more or less, and the quiet houses\n",
      "stood in gardens. Hagiwara wielded his heavy battledore with great skill\n",
      "and grace, catching the gilded shuttlecock and tossing it lightly into\n",
      "the air; but at length with a careless or an ill-judged stroke, he sent\n",
      "it flying over the heads of the players, and over the bamboo fence of a\n",
      "garden near by. Immediately he started after it. Then his companions\n",
      "cried, “Stay, Hagiwara; here we have more than a dozen shuttlecocks.”\n",
      "“Nay,” he said, “but this was dove-coloured and gilded.”\n",
      "“Foolish one!” answered his friends; “here we have six shuttlecocks all\n",
      "dove-coloured and gilded.”\n",
      "But he paid them no heed, for he had become full of a very strange\n",
      "desire for the shuttlecock he had lost. He scaled the bamboo fence and\n",
      "dropped into the garden which was upon the farther side. Now he had\n",
      "marked the very spot where the shuttlecock should have fallen, but it\n",
      "was not there; so he searched along the foot of the bamboo fence--but\n",
      "no, he could not find it. Up and down he went, beating the bushes with\n",
      "his battledore, his eyes on the ground, drawing breath heavily as if he\n",
      "had lost his dearest treasure. His friends called him, but he did not\n",
      "come, and they grew tired and went to their own homes. The light of day\n",
      "began to fail. Hagiwara, the _samurai_, looked up and saw a girl\n",
      "standing a few yards away from him. She beckoned him with her right\n",
      "hand, and in her left she held a gilded shuttlecock with dove-coloured\n",
      "feathers.\n",
      "The _samurai_ shouted joyfully and ran forward. Then the girl drew away\n",
      "from him, still beckoning him with the right hand. The shuttlecock\n",
      "lured him, and he followed. So they went, the two of them, till they\n",
      "came to the house that was in the garden, and three stone steps that led\n",
      "up to it. Beside the lowest step there grew a plum tree in blossom, and\n",
      "upon the highest step there stood a fair and very young lady. She was\n",
      "most splendidly attired in robes of high festival. Her _kimono_ was of\n",
      "water-blue silk, with sleeves of ceremony so long that they touched the\n",
      "ground; her under-dress was scarlet, and her great girdle of brocade was\n",
      "stiff and heavy with gold. In her hair were pins of gold and\n",
      "tortoiseshell and coral.\n",
      "When Hagiwara saw the lady, he knelt down forthwith and made her due\n",
      "obeisance, till his forehead touched the ground.\n",
      "Then the lady spoke, smiling with pleasure like a child. “Come into my\n",
      "house, Hagiwara Sama, _samurai_ of the _hatamoto_. I am O’Tsuyu, the\n",
      "Lady of the Morning Dew. My dear handmaiden, O’Yoné, has brought you to\n",
      "me. Come in, Hagiwara Sama, _samurai_ of the _hatamoto_; for indeed I am\n",
      "glad to see you, and happy is this hour.”\n",
      "So the _samurai_ went in, and they brought him to a room of ten mats,\n",
      "where they entertained him; for the Lady of the Morning Dew danced\n",
      "before him in the ancient manner, whilst O’Yoné, the handmaiden, beat\n",
      "upon a small scarlet-tasselled drum.\n",
      "Afterwards they set food before him, the red rice of the festival and\n",
      "sweet warm wine, and he ate and drank of the food they gave him.\n",
      "It was dark night when Hagiwara took his leave. “Come again, honourable\n",
      "lord, come again,” said O’Yoné the handmaiden.\n",
      "“Yea, lord, you needs must come,” whispered the Lady of the Morning Dew.\n",
      "The _samurai_ laughed. “And if I do not come?” he said mockingly. “What\n",
      "if I do not come?”\n",
      "The lady stiffened, and her child’s face grew grey, but she laid her\n",
      "hand upon Hagiwara’s shoulder.\n",
      "“Then,” she said, “it will be death, lord. Death it will be for you and\n",
      "for me. There is no other way.” O’Yoné shuddered and hid her eyes with\n",
      "her sleeve.\n",
      "The _samurai_ went out into the night, being very much afraid.\n",
      "Long, long he sought for his home and could not find it, wandering in\n",
      "the black darkness from end to end of the sleeping city. When at last he\n",
      "reached his familiar door the late dawn was almost come, and wearily he\n",
      "threw himself upon his bed. Then he laughed. “After all, I have left\n",
      "behind me my shuttlecock,” said Hagiwara the _samurai_.\n",
      "The next day Hagiwara sat alone in his house from morning till evening.\n",
      "He had his hands before him; and he thought, but did nothing more. At\n",
      "the end of the time he said, “It is a joke that a couple of _geisha_\n",
      "have sought to play on me. Excellent, in faith, but they shall not have\n",
      "me!” So he dressed himself in his best and went forth to join his\n",
      "friends. For five or six days he was at joustings and junketings, the\n",
      "gayest of the gay. His wit was ready, his spirits were wild.\n",
      "Then he said, “By the gods, I am deathly sick of this,” and took to\n",
      "walking the streets of Yedo alone. From end to end of the great city he\n",
      "went. He wandered by day and he wandered by night, by street and alley\n",
      "he went, by hill and moat and castle wall, but he found not what he\n",
      "sought. He could not come upon the garden where his shuttlecock was\n",
      "lost, nor yet upon the Lady of the Morning Dew. His spirit had no rest.\n",
      "He fell sick and took to his bed, where he neither ate nor slept, but\n",
      "grew spectre-thin. This was about the third month. In the sixth month,\n",
      "at the time of _niubai_, the hot and rainy season, he rose up, and, in\n",
      "spite of all his faithful servant could say or do to dissuade him, he\n",
      "wrapped a loose summer robe about him and at once went forth.\n",
      "“Alack! Alack!” cried the servant, “the youth has the fever, or he is\n",
      "perchance mad.”\n",
      "Hagiwara faltered not at all. He looked neither to the right nor to the\n",
      "left. Straight forward he went, for he said to himself, “All roads lead\n",
      "past my love’s house.” Soon he came to a quiet suburb, and to a certain\n",
      "house whose garden had a split bamboo fence. Hagiwara laughed softly and\n",
      "scaled the fence.\n",
      "“The same, the very same shall be the manner of our meeting,” he said.\n",
      "He found the garden wild and overgrown. Moss covered the three stone\n",
      "steps. The plum tree that grew there fluttered its green leaves\n",
      "disconsolate. The house was still, its shutters were all closed, it was\n",
      "forlorn and deserted.\n",
      "The _samurai_ grew cold as he stood and wondered. A soaking rain fell.\n",
      "There came an old man into the garden. He said to Hagiwara:\n",
      "“Sir, what do you do here?”\n",
      "“The white flower has fallen from the plum tree,” said the _samurai_.\n",
      "“Where is the Lady of the Morning Dew?”\n",
      "“She is dead,” answered the old man; “dead these five or six moons, of a\n",
      "strange and sudden sickness. She lies in the graveyard on the hill, and\n",
      "O’Yoné, her handmaid, lies by her side. She could not suffer her\n",
      "mistress to wander alone through the long night of Yomi. For their sweet\n",
      "spirits’ sake I would still tend this garden, but I am old and it is\n",
      "little that I can do. Oh, sir, they are dead indeed. The grass grows on\n",
      "their graves.”\n",
      "Hagiwara went to his own home. He took a slip of pure white wood and he\n",
      "wrote upon it, in large fair characters, the dear name of his lady. This\n",
      "he set up, and burned before it incense and sweet odours, and made every\n",
      "offering that was meet, and did due observance, and all for the welfare\n",
      "of her departed spirit.\n",
      "Then drew near the Festival of _Bon_, the time of returning souls. The\n",
      "good folk of Yedo took lanterns and visited their graves. Bringing food\n",
      "and flowers, they cared for their beloved dead. On the thirteenth day\n",
      "of the seventh month, which, in the _Bon_, is the day of days, Hagiwara\n",
      "the _samurai_ walked in his garden by night for the sake of the\n",
      "coolness. It was windless and dark. A cicala hidden in the heart of a\n",
      "pomegranate flower sang shrilly now and again. Now and again a carp\n",
      "leaped in the round pond. For the rest it was still, and never a leaf\n",
      "stirred.\n",
      "About the hour of the Ox, Hagiwara heard the sound of footsteps in the\n",
      "lane that lay beyond his garden hedge. Nearer and nearer they came.\n",
      "“Women’s _geta_,” said the _samurai_. He knew them by the hollow echoing\n",
      "noise. Looking over his rose hedge, he saw two slender women come out of\n",
      "the dimness hand in hand. One of them carried a lantern with a bunch of\n",
      "peony flowers tied to the handle. It was such a lantern as is used at\n",
      "the time of the _Bon_ in the service of the dead. It swung as the two\n",
      "women walked, casting an uncertain light. As they came abreast of the\n",
      "_samurai_ upon the other side of the hedge, they turned their faces to\n",
      "him. He knew them at once, and gave one great cry.\n",
      "The girl with the peony lantern held it up so that the light fell upon\n",
      "him.\n",
      "“Hagiwara Sama,” she cried, “by all that is most wonderful! Why, lord,\n",
      "we were told that you were dead. We have daily recited the _Nembutsu_\n",
      "for your soul these many moons!”\n",
      "“Come in, come in, O’Yoné,” he said; “and is it indeed your mistress\n",
      "that you hold by the hand? Can it be my lady?... Oh, my love!”\n",
      "O’Yoné answered, “Who else should it be?” and the two came in at the\n",
      "garden gate.\n",
      "But the Lady of the Morning Dew held up her sleeve to hide her face.\n",
      "“How was it I lost you?” said the _samurai_; “how was it I lost you,\n",
      "O’Yoné?”\n",
      "“Lord,” she said, “we have moved to a little house, a very little house,\n",
      "in the quarter of the city which is called the Green Hill. We were\n",
      "suffered to take nothing with us there, and we are grown very poor. With\n",
      "grief and want my mistress is become pale.”\n",
      "Then Hagiwara took his lady’s sleeve to draw it gently from her face.\n",
      "“Lord,” she sobbed, “you will not love me, I am not fair.”\n",
      "But when he looked upon her his love flamed up within him like a\n",
      "consuming fire, and shook him from head to foot. He said never a word.\n",
      "She drooped. “Lord,” she murmured, “shall I go or stay?”\n",
      "And he said, “Stay.”\n",
      "A little before daybreak the _samurai_ fell into a deep sleep, and awoke\n",
      "to find himself alone in the clear light of the morning. He lost not an\n",
      "instant, but rose and went forth, and immediately made his way through\n",
      "Yedo to the quarter of the city which is called the Green Hill. Here he\n",
      "inquired for the house of the Lady of the Morning Dew, but no one could\n",
      "direct him. High and low he searched fruitlessly. It seemed to him that\n",
      "for the second time he had lost his dear lady, and he turned homewards\n",
      "in bitter despair. His way led him through the grounds of a certain\n",
      "temple, and as he went he marked two graves that were side by side. One\n",
      "was little and obscure, but the other was marked by a fair monument,\n",
      "like the tomb of some great one. Before the monument there hung a\n",
      "lantern with a bunch of peony flowers tied to its handle. It was such a\n",
      "lantern as is used at the time of _Bon_ in the service of the dead.\n",
      "Long, long did the _samurai_ stand as one in a dream. Then he smiled a\n",
      "little and said:\n",
      "“‘_We have moved to a little house ... a very little house ... upon the\n",
      "Green Hill ... we were suffered to take nothing with us there and we are\n",
      "grown very poor ... with grief and want my mistress is become pale...._’\n",
      "A little house, a dark house, yet you will make room for me, oh, my\n",
      "beloved, pale one of my desires. We have loved for the space of ten\n",
      "existences, leave me not now ... my dear.” Then he went home.\n",
      "His faithful servant met him and cried:\n",
      "“Now what ails you, master?”\n",
      "He said, “Why, nothing at all.... I was never merrier.”\n",
      "But the servant departed weeping, and saying, “The mark of death is on\n",
      "his face ... and I, whither shall I go that bore him as a child in these\n",
      "arms?”\n",
      "Every night, for seven nights, the maidens with the peony lantern came\n",
      "to Hagiwara’s dwelling. Fair weather or foul was the same to them. They\n",
      "came at the hour of the Ox. There was mystic wooing. By the strong bond\n",
      "of illusion the living and the dead were bound together.\n",
      "On the seventh night the servant of the _samurai_, wakeful with fear and\n",
      "sorrow, made bold to peer into his lord’s room through a crack in the\n",
      "wooden shutters. His hair stood on end and his blood ran cold to see\n",
      "Hagiwara in the arms of a fearful thing, smiling up at the horror that\n",
      "was its face, stroking its dank green robe with languid fingers. With\n",
      "daylight the servant made his way to a holy man of his acquaintance.\n",
      "When he had told his tale he asked, “Is there any hope for Hagiwara\n",
      "Sama?”\n",
      "“Alack,” said the holy man, “who can withstand the power of Karma?\n",
      "Nevertheless, there is a little hope.” So he told the servant what he\n",
      "must do. Before nightfall, this one had set a sacred text above every\n",
      "door and window-place of his master’s house, and he had rolled in the\n",
      "silk of his master’s girdle a golden emblem of the Tathagata. When these\n",
      "things were done, Hagiwara being drawn two ways became himself as weak\n",
      "as water. And his servant took him in his arms, laid him upon his bed\n",
      "and covered him lightly, and saw him fall into a deep sleep.\n",
      "At the hour of the Ox there was heard the sound of footsteps in the\n",
      "lane, without the garden hedge. Nearer and nearer they came. They grew\n",
      "slow and stopped.\n",
      "“What means this, O’Yoné, O’Yoné?” said a piteous voice. “The house is\n",
      "asleep, and I do not see my lord.”\n",
      "“Come home, sweet lady, Hagiwara’s heart is changed.”\n",
      "“That I will not, O’Yoné, O’Yoné ... you must find a way to bring me to\n",
      "my lord.”\n",
      "“Lady, we cannot enter here. See the Holy Writing over every door and\n",
      "window-place ... we may not enter here.”\n",
      "There was a sound of bitter weeping and a long wail.\n",
      "“Lord, I have loved thee through the space of ten existences.” Then the\n",
      "footsteps retreated and their echo died away.\n",
      "The next night it was quite the same. Hagiwara slept in his weakness;\n",
      "his servant watched; the wraiths came and departed in sobbing despair.\n",
      "The third day, when Hagiwara went to the bath, a thief stole the emblem,\n",
      "the golden emblem of the Tathagata, from his girdle. Hagiwara did not\n",
      "mark it. But that night he lay awake. It was his servant that slept,\n",
      "worn out with watching. Presently a great rain fell and Hagiwara,\n",
      "waking, heard the sound of it upon the roof. The heavens were opened and\n",
      "for hours the rain fell. And it tore the holy text from over the round\n",
      "window in Hagiwara’s chamber.\n",
      "At the hour of the Ox there was heard the sound of footsteps in the lane\n",
      "without the garden hedge. Nearer and nearer they came. They grew slow\n",
      "and stopped.\n",
      "“This is the last time, O’Yoné, O’Yoné, therefore bring me to my lord.\n",
      "Think of the love of ten existences. Great is the power of Karma. There\n",
      "must be a way....”\n",
      "“Come, my beloved,” called Hagiwara with a great voice.\n",
      "“Open, lord ... open and I come.”\n",
      "But Hagiwara could not move from his couch.\n",
      "“Come, my beloved,” he called for the second time.\n",
      "“I cannot come, though the separation wounds me like a sharp sword. Thus\n",
      "we suffer for the sins of a former life.” So the lady spoke and moaned\n",
      "like the lost soul that she was. But O’Yoné took her hand.\n",
      "“See the round window,” she said.\n",
      "Hand in hand the two rose lightly from the earth. Like vapour they\n",
      "passed through the unguarded window. The _samurai_ called, “Come to me,\n",
      "beloved,” for the third time.\n",
      "He was answered, “Lord, I come.”\n",
      "In the grey morning Hagiwara’s servant found his master cold and dead.\n",
      "At his feet stood the peony lantern burning with a weird yellow flame.\n",
      "The servant shivered, took up the lantern and blew out the light; for “I\n",
      "cannot bear it,” he said.\n",
